        title: Nigeria is struggling to get informal workers to save
        text: 'B ETWEEN A SLUMPING economy and gnawing inflation, Nigerians are finding
            life tough. Temilola Balogun, who owns a clothing shop in Lagos, the commercial
            capital, sighs that it is hard to save anything. This is typical: most
            adults in Africa’s most populous country do not pay into a pension. Few
            will be able to retire without being supported by their children.

            To change this, in 2019 the government started a “micro-pensions” scheme
            aimed primarily at informal workers, who make up 80% of the workforce.
            This is more flexible than old-school pension plans that have hefty fees,
            high minimum contributions and, in some cases, charge penalties for missed
            payments. Similar plans have worked in countries such as Kenya, which
            in 2011 launched its Mbao plan. It allows savers to contribute as little
            as 20 shillings ($0.19) a day. By 2018 it had 100,000 members. Nigeria
            hopes that 30% of working-age people will have pensions by 2024.


            Getting there will be a challenge. Pension systems are typically built
            for employees with stable incomes, not those with the precarious incomes
            of informal jobs. “They’re thinking about what they need to earn to eat
            today,” not what they might save, says Oguche Agudah, who heads the Pension
            Fund Operators Association of Nigeria, a trade body.


            There are other problems, too. Pension firms see lots of cost and little
            profit in harvesting small pots of savings. And in a country with high
            levels of corruption, many Nigerians are reluctant to hand over their
            money. For all these reasons the Nigerian scheme has got off to a stuttering
            start. By December only 62,000 people had signed up for micro-pensions.


            Startups may change that. Awabah, a Nigerian fintech company whose name
            means “Our money” in the local pidgin, is trying to use “dumb” mobile
            phones to gather savings. It says the technology can lower costs and reach
            the unbanked in the countryside. The firm’s agents teach people about
            inflation and the benefits of compound interest.


            If startups can, indeed, help micro-pensions take off, the benefits would
            go beyond helping people save. Pooled together, micro-pensions could add
            up to large sums of capital that could be invested in infrastructure or
            businesses, which is exactly what Nigeria needs to provide jobs for its
            fast-growing population.'

        title: Iranians worry that their new government is inept
        text: 'I T WAS FITTING that Ebrahim Raisi, Iran’s new president, spent the
            first working day of his government visiting a cemetery, since he had
            helped orchestrate the mass execution of political prisoners in the 1980s.
            The setting also fitted the country’s glum mood. Since Mr Raisi’s victory
            in a rigged election on June 18th, cases of covid-19 in Iran have spiked.
            The daily death toll is among the highest in the world.

            Most Iranians blame the country’s (unelected) clerical regime. In January
            the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, banned the import of Western
            vaccines because America is “untrustworthy”. He later backtracked, but
            the roll-out has been too slow to help stem the Delta variant.


            It now falls to Mr Raisi (pictured) to deal with the health crisis, as
            well as a sinking economy. His relatively moderate predecessor, Hassan
            Rouhani, struggled in the face of hardline opposition. Some think the
            election of Mr Raisi, a protégé of the supreme leader, will at least make
            the government more coherent.


            The new cabinet is certainly more hardline than Mr Rouhani’s. It includes
            no women, but plenty of men under sanctions by Western countries, including
            the president himself. Seven of the 19 seats went to people associated
            with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ), Iran’s strongest
            military force, including four former commanders. Five cabinet members
            come from Astan-e Quds-e Razavi, the largest bonyad, or clerical conglomerate,
            which Mr Raisi used to run. Six more are from the judiciary, another conservative
            bastion formerly headed by Mr Raisi.


            Mr Khamenei will have more of a hold over this administration. Not only
            did he choose Mr Raisi, he probably steered him towards Muhammad Mokhber,
            the new senior vice-president and manager of one of Mr Khamenei’s largest
            economic holdings. Mr Mokhber is one of many cabinet officials to have
            worked under the supreme leader. Mohammad Esmaili headed a supervisory
            body of Iran''s state broadcaster controlled by Mr Khamenei. Now he is
            the culture minister, lashing out at the “the deviation and secularism”
            of Iran’s cinema, theatre and music.


            But the new cabinet is not as coherent as it might appear. It includes
            free-marketeers and socialists, populists, realists and ideologues. With
            Mr Khamenei ailing, Mr Raisi may be trying to woo a broad range of those
            who would determine the future supreme leader. Iranians, though, fear
            that the ministers will battle over the spoils of power, awarding themselves
            and their allies the best jobs and perks. They have already grabbed scarce
            Pfizer and AstraZeneca jabs, say critics, leaving a home-grown (and unproven)
            vaccine for the masses.


            GDP per person has dropped by about 15% since 2018. The government seems
            to have no convincing answers. “They hint at having a plan, but there’s
            no substance to it,” says Sanam Vakil of Chatham House, a think-tank in
            London. “The conservatives are not unified on economic issues, so you
            get a mix of populism and neoliberalism.” Mr Raisi and his ministers have
            promised to produce 1m affordable homes a year. How they will pay for
            them is unclear. Earlier this year the new vice-president for economic
            affairs, Mohsen Rezaei, suggested a novel way to boost Iran’s hard-currency
            reserves: by seizing Western soldiers and demanding ransoms.


            The best way to help the economy would be to revive the deal signed in
            2015 by Iran and six world powers. It required Iran to curb its nuclear
            programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Donald
            Trump pulled America out of the deal in 2018 and cut Iran off from the
            world economy. But President Joe Biden wants to renew it. Mr Raisi, for
            his part, says he supports the resumption of indirect talks between America
            and Iran.'

        title: Alpha Condé, the president of Guinea, is ousted in a coup
        text: 'T HE FIRST sign was gunfire on the streets of Conakry, Guinea’s capital,
            on the morning of September 5th. Soon after, unauthenticated videos spread
            on social media showing President Alpha Condé, looking stunned and dishevelled,
            surrounded by masked soldiers. “Have we touched a single hair on your
            head?” demands one soldier of the 83-year-old. Before the day was out,
            soldiers draped in Guinean flags appeared on television. “The personalisation
            of political life is over. We will no longer entrust politics to one man,
            we will entrust it to the people,” said Lieutenant Colonel Mamady Doumbouya
            (pictured, waving), the head of Guinea’s special forces and leader of
            the coup, as he declared the constitution and government dissolved. “Look
            at the state of our roads, of our hospitals,” he said. “It’s time for
            us to wake up.”

            Mr Condé’s overthrow marks a sorry finale to a presidency that once promised
            much but has long disappointed. It is a dangerous moment for this suffering
            country of 13m people. The coup is also the latest lurch in an accelerating
            decline of democracy across much of Africa. The trend has raised fears
            of a return to the bad old days of plentiful putsches, especially in the
            west of the continent.


            When Mr Condé, a veteran opposition leader, took office in 2010, he became
            Guinea’s first democratically elected president. He declared he would
            try to be “Guinea’s Mandela”. Yet his commitment to democracy proved fickle.
            In March last year, after two terms in office, he pushed through a new
            constitution that permitted him to run for another two six-year terms.
            Angry Guineans took to the streets but were clobbered by security forces,
            who killed dozens of them. After an election in October 2020, the electoral
            commission declared Mr Condé victorious.


            This was angrily disputed by his main rival, Cellou Dalein Diallo, and
            questioned by outsiders. Mr Condé responded by sending in the troops to
            surround Mr Diallo’s house for days and by locking up hundreds of opposition
            members and activists. Once again the security forces put down protests,
            killing dozens.


            Many Guineans have celebrated the coup in the streets. Mr Condé’s authoritarian
            ways were not the only thing that had been frustrating them. The country
            boasts the world’s largest reserves of bauxite, used to make aluminium,
            and for the past five years economic growth has topped 5% a year. Yet
            more than 70% of the population eke out a living on less than the equivalent
            of $3.20 a day.


            Guineans tell pollsters that corruption has been getting worse. In recent
            weeks the government has also raised taxes. The price of fuel has jumped
            by 20%. For those celebrating, even change through the barrel of a gun
            represents hope. “We cannot help but feel relieved,” Mr Diallo tells The
            Economist. The coup leaders have freed about 80 political prisoners and
            promise a government of “national unity” and an “inclusive and peaceful
            transition”.


            Yet things could easily get worse. Mr Diallo, whose opposition alliance
            released a statement in support of the junta, admits he has received no
            specific assurances as to when elections will happen or whether civilians
            will be included in the transitional government. Lieut-Colonel Doumbouya,
            who served in the French Foreign Legion, has already installed army officers
            as heads of every region in the country.


            Soldiers making vague promises of democracy to fob off regional and Western
            powers, while doing nothing to bring it about, sounds horribly familiar.
            In next-door Mali, soldiers have recently staged two coups. In Chad, they
            staged one in April. The meek international reaction to those putsches
            may have emboldened Guinea’s special forces. As soldiers were taking over
            in Guinea, a delegation from the Economic Community of West African States
            (ECOWAS) , the 15-country regional bloc, was in Mali trying to persuade
            the junta there to keep its promise to hold elections in February. Yet
            preparations for those polls are badly off track. The delegation said
            it was “concerned”—but merely asked everyone to “work together” to prepare.
            Lieut-Colonel Doumbouya, who is thought to know Mali’s coup leader personally,
            may take note. Democratic institutions are hard to build but easy to undermine—and
            across much of the region they are being dismantled. The dismal trend
            began before this year’s slew of coups. Mr Condé’s constitutional mangling
            met little international or regional resistance. Neighbours kept quieter
            still when President Alassane Ouattara repeated the trick in the Ivory
            Coast. In Chad, in the name of regional security, France and America have
            long turned a blind eye to rigged elections and violence against the opposition.
            In Benin few noticed when President Patrice Talon blocked, exiled and
            arrested members of the opposition. If a country’s leaders do not care
            enough about democratic institutions to play by the rules—and if outsiders
            ignore the steady undermining of institutions—it is hardly surprising
            that men with guns have no qualms about smashing those institutions altogether.
            For the moment, ECOWAS has suspended Guinea from the bloc and threatened
            sanctions, but it may struggle to respond effectively. Unlike Mali and
            many of its neighbours, which share a currency, Guinea has its own money.
            After Mali’s coup, the bloc got the regional central bank to shut down
            all operations in that country, though in due course it relented. That
            will not be possible in Guinea. Shutting land borders, another common
            way to apply pressure, will not rattle Guinea, a coastal country. Western
            governments have condemned the coup and called for Mr Condé''s release.
            But their leverage is limited. Russia was conspicuous in providing Guinea
            with its first covid-19 vaccines this year. China is influential, too;
            more than half of its imported bauxite comes from Guinea (see Finance
            section). Both have condemned the coup but are unlikely to do much more,
            especially as Lieut-Colonel Doumbouya was quick to emphasise that mining
            can continue as normal.


            Guinea’s recent history is not reassuring. The leader of a coup in 2008
            broke his promise not to stand in the subsequent elections. When tens
            of thousands gathered in a stadium in Conakry to protest, soldiers opened
            fire, killing at least 150. They raped dozens of women in the stadium,
            too. Today things are different, insists Lieut-Colonel Doumbouya: “We
            no longer need to rape Guinea. We just need to make love to her.”'

        title: What the travails of a reformist governor say about Nigeria
        text: 'S TANDING AT ABOUT five-foot-four, Nasir El-Rufai, governor of Nigeria’s
            northern state of Kaduna, says he models himself on Deng Xiaoping, who
            put China on a path to growth after the misery of rule by Mao Zedong.
            Mr El-Rufai sees a new path for Kaduna and, some say, for Nigeria itself.


            Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

            Mr El-Rufai prizes education: he has a law degree from London, a master’s
            in public administration from Harvard and is writing a doctorate at Maastricht
            university. He is usually addressed by the title “Mallam”, out of respect
            for his erudition, particularly in Koranic studies. So it may seem odd
            that one of his early acts as governor was to fire almost 22,000 primary-school
            teachers. Yet he had cause. Those he booted out had failed a test designed
            for nine-year-olds. Some couldn’t complete a comprehension test. Others
            couldn’t name a rectangle. Mr El-Rufai has sacked thousands more workers.
            And he is not done.


            With two years left of his second term, the governor is determined to
            balance the state’s budget by reducing the number of people working for
            the government. This is something of a rarity in Nigeria, where the governor
            of another state recently boasted he had hired 38,000 aides, ostensibly
            to reduce poverty, arguing it was better to spend money on employing people
            than to invest in roads or ports.


            When Nigeria locked down last year to slow the spread of covid-19, it
            quickly became clear that Kaduna’s administration was not noticeably worse
            with most of the state’s employees not working than when they were supposedly
            toiling in the service of taxpayers. Since then Mr El-Rufai has proposed
            to sack a further 7,000 government workers.


            His latest move has provoked the trade unions, whose members went on strike
            under banners reading “Hell-Rufai”. Once seen as a liberal, he now has
            a reputation as a harsh disciplinarian. Yet the governor is undaunted.
            He has dared disgruntled workers to challenge him in court.


            Though his means may be unpopular and his critics accuse him of riding
            roughshod over opponents, his case for streamlining the civil service
            is strong. Of the 50bn naira ($121m) that Kaduna will receive this year
            from the federal government (its main source of funds), it will spend
            about 80% on staff salaries. This is an improvement on last year, when
            personnel costs outstripped the federal allocation.


            Mr El-Rufai argues that unless he can slim the payroll, he will not have
            the cash to invest in good things like hospitals and bridges. It could
            also free up funds to fight insecurity, a persistent scourge in Nigeria’s
            northern states, bedevilled by gangs of kidnappers and by fighting between
            crop farmers and cattle herders. Sectarian tension in the north between
            the Muslim majority and the Christian minority is another frequent source
            of violence. Since Mr El-Rufai was elected governor in 2015 the number
            of ethnic clashes has fallen.


            The governor, who is thought to have presidential ambitions, has had little
            support for his reforms from the federal government or ruling party, of
            which he is a member. Yet he is pushing on regardless. He believes that
            just like Deng, who revoked many of Mao’s stifling economic policies,
            he may have to defy his party in order to force through his plans.


            But Mr El-Rufai would do well to remember that he must worry about more
            than just his party. Unlike leaders of China, who can lock up critics
            and never face voters, he operates in a raucous democracy. In June his
            party lost a by-election in Kaduna, perhaps an early sign of a backlash
            against his policies. If he does not keep an eye on his dwindling popularity,
            he may soon have little chance to reform anything. '

            capital. The Israelis were at pains to emphasise that they had discussed
            only “routine security matters” and that “there is no diplomatic process
            with the Palestinians and will not be.” Mr Gantz touched on nothing of
            substance, least of all the long-moribund peace process.

            The new Israeli government, which came to office on June 13th, is too
            fragile to make any serious moves on this front. Its prime minister, Naftali
            Bennett, and three of the eight parties in his coalition, are adamantly
            opposed to territorial concessions to the Palestinians. Mr Bennett is
            flatly against the creation of a Palestinian state.


            The new government also includes centrists and left-wingers and, for the
            first time, an Arab-Israeli party. Most of them support establishing a
            Palestinian state. Unlike the previous government, led by Binyamin Netanyahu,
            it will not seek to build new Jewish settlements on the Palestinians’
            West Bank, nor will it annex bits of it. But nor will it try to solve
            the enduring conflict between Israel and Palestine.


            Like its predecessor, Israel’s government will make sure that America
            remains its most stalwart guarantor. Five days before Mr Gantz’s handshake
            with the Palestinian leader, Mr Bennett arrived in Washington on his first
            major foreign trip, to meet President Joe Biden (pictured), whose administration
            was relieved to see the back of Mr Netanyahu, a close ally of Donald Trump.
            Mr Biden delighted the Israelis with tough talk on Iran. However, they
            exchanged only the blandest of bromides on peace between Israelis and
            Palestinians.


            Israel’s new government is enjoying a honeymoon in its relations with
            other Western governments, too. Unless another big wave of violence breaks
            out, like the 11-day war over Gaza in May and the accompanying ructions
            in Israel, Mr Bennett’s government is unlikely to come under renewed diplomatic
            pressure soon. It has already improved strained relations with Israel’s
            neighbours, Jordan and Egypt.


            Its new foreign minister, Yair Lapid, who is due to replace Mr Bennett
            as prime minister in two years, is a centrist who intends to shift the
            emphasis of Israel’s diplomatic alliances. Mr Netanyahu loved to hobnob
            with like-minded populists, such as India’s Narendra Modi and Brazil’s
            Jair Bolsonaro. In Europe he applauded the leaders of Hungary and Poland.


            Mr Lapid has distanced himself from such associations. And he has vigorously
            tackled Poland’s government over a law that restricts survivors of the
            Holocaust and their heirs from claiming property they owned before the
            second world war.


            But on the biggest issue confronting any Israeli government—relations
            with the Palestinians—the fundamentals remain the same. The new Israeli
            leaders may be harking back to the old if rebranded concept of “shrinking
            the conflict” rather than solving it. Their hope is that the Palestinians
            will be content with increased “self-governance” and more economic aid
            within the West Bank. At a later stage, the blockade imposed by Israel
            and Egypt on Gaza for the past 14 years may be eased.


            Meanwhile, the core issues of Palestinian statehood, demarcating the borders
            and granting rights to Palestinian refugees will be deferred indefinitely.
            “The important thing is not to cause any unnecessary problems and try
            to make life easier for the Palestinians,” says an aide to Mr Bennett.


            For their part, the Palestinians are making it easier for Israel to push
            their cause to the margins. Mr Abbas, now in the 17th year of what was
            supposed to be a four-year term, has refused to hold elections either
            for the presidency or for the Palestinian parliament. His administration
            is widely seen as corrupt and ineffectual. Like the previous Israeli government,
            the new one seems indifferent to the Palestinians’ fate. There may be
            bouts of violence for years to come. Meanwhile it is betting on “managing
            the conflict”. '

        title: Arab states are wrecking old treasures
        text: 'T HE FIGHTERS of Islamic State turned sledgehammers and drills on ancient
            temples after conquering north-western Iraq and north-eastern Syria in
            2014. They raided the tombs of Assyrian kings in Nineveh, blew up Roman
            colonnades in Palmyra and sold priceless relics to smugglers. But their
            vandalism was on a modest scale compared with some of the megaprojects
            that are habitually undertaken by many Middle Eastern governments. A few
            months ago, a short distance downriver from the archway toppled by the
            jihadists in Ashur, the religious capital of the Assyrian empire, Iraq’s
            government began to build the Makhoul dam. Once complete, it is likely
            to flood Ashur—and another 200 historical sites.

            Similar archaeological tragedies have occurred across the region, mainly
            thanks to the appetite of governments for gigantism in the name of modernisation.
            Some want to stamp a new identity on an old land. Corruption often plays
            a part: the bigger the project, the bigger the contractors’ bribes. Human
            tragedies often ensue. The re-landscaping displaces people as well as
            erasing their heritage, sometimes as a kind of social engineering.


            Governments the world over mould landscapes with grand schemes. But in
            the Middle East they interfere more than most, says Jala Makhzoumi of
            the American University of Beirut. In part this is because large and growing
            populations are packed into such small habitable areas. With a megaproject
            or two, governments argue that they can overcome poverty and decrepit
            services by bringing electricity and infrastructure. By providing irrigation
            to make deserts bloom, they can feed people.


            Such, at least, was the reasoning behind the Makhoul dam, a few hours’
            drive north of Baghdad. Back in 2002, when Saddam Hussein first broached
            its construction, UNESCO , the UN ’s heritage body, warned that “an essential
            element of human civilisation would disappear for ever”.


            Appeals to Saddam’s successors to stop the diggers have fallen on deaf
            ears. “This government cares nothing for the history of Iraq and the tens
            of thousands of sites in the cradle of civilisation,” says Azzam Alwash,
            an Iraqi environmentalist.


            At least since the time of Pharaoh Zoser, Middle Eastern rulers have tried
            to express the grandeur of their vision in stone, and today’s lot are
            no exception. “They want something impressive but too often they ruin
            the landscape and displace and alienate people,” laments Ms Makhzoumi.
            Egypt’s dictator, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, has bulldozed swathes of Cairo,
            the old capital, to make way for motorways, flyovers and shiny skyscrapers
            that line the road to the new administrative capital he is building.


            To ease congestion he has scythed a thoroughfare named Paradise through
            the City of the Dead, a 1,000-year-old necropolis that is a UN -designated
            world heritage site. Hundreds of tombs were destroyed. He has turfed out
            tens of thousands of people from their homes in Boulaq, along the Nile,
            calling it slum clearance. This was where Cairo’s old port prospered in
            Ottoman times. Instead of rehabilitating it, Mr Sisi is letting property
            magnates carpet the area with high-rise apartment buildings.


            Look on my works, ye mighty


            Mr Sisi has allowed investors from the United Arab Emirates to build a
            mini-Dubai on Cairo’s largest green space, a nature reserve on al-Warraq
            island. Its 90,000 residents will be shunted off, mainly to estates on
            the city’s edge. Protesters have been condemned as Islamist terrorists
            and sent to prison, many for 15 years.


            Mr Sisi is not the first modern Egyptian ruler with pharaonic ambitions.
            Gamal Abdel Nasser put up Aswan’s High Dam in the 1960s to regulate seasonal
            floods and provide electricity, while also submerging the cradle of ancient
            Nubian civilisation. Western archaeologists rushed to save as many temples,
            tombs and cities as they could along 550km of the Nile. Some of the rescued
            antiquities still adorn Western museums. To this day displaced Nubians
            campaign to be allowed to return to the water’s edge. Tens of thousands
            of them should be compensated for their lost land and homes, activists
            argue. Sudan’s recently ousted Islamist regime, deeming Nubian and Pharaonic
            relics heretical, extended the damage southwards up the Nile in 2009 by
            completing the Merowe dam, flooding another 170km of Nubia’s past.


            Some rulers have security in mind when they bulldoze history. Mr Sisi
            can send in the tanks faster on wider roads. Removing Egypt’s poor from
            city centres may curb the risk of revolution. “They know that poor areas
            revolted in 2011,” says Abdelrahman Hegazy, a Cairene city planner. “They’re
            afraid of population density.” During Syria’s current civil war, President
            Bashar al-Assad and his Russian patrons ruined parts of the old cities
            of Homs and Aleppo, treasure troves of antiquity that were also rebel
            strongholds, with relentless barrel-bombing.


            Israel also has a tendency to obliterate the past, in its case to discourage
            the return of Palestinian former inhabitants or their descendants. The
            names of their villages, now often hidden beneath forests planted on once-terraced
            hills, have been expunged from modern maps. A recent exhibition at Israel’s
            national art museum in Tel Aviv recorded the villages’ vanished contours
            using drone photography. “We want to put the villages back on the map,”
            says Miki Kratsman, a photographer involved in the show. Even that would
            be futile in Libya, where Muammar Qaddafi, its former dictator, obliterated
            much of his country’s Jewish past by building its poshest hotel, the Corinthia,
            on the Jewish quarter in Tripoli, the capital.


            Occasionally the damage is partially reversible. America is returning
            more than 17,000 old artefacts smuggled out of Iraq since its invasion
            in 2003. And the UN is helping to rebuild medieval mosques, churches and
            souks in the Iraqi city of Mosul that America and its allies flattened
            while destroying Islamic State’s caliphate in 2017. Bassel Hariri, a Syrian
            exile in London, is rebuilding Aleppo—as a virtual city. His 150,000 followers
            on Facebook share their testimonies of the city they lost.


            Governments sometimes have second thoughts. After long decrying ancient
            Nabataean rock tombs as pagan idolatry, Saudi Arabia’s rulers now promote
            them as tourist attractions. Saudi officials even speak of reopening ancient
            churches, whose very existence they used to deny, not just to tourists
            but also to worshippers. '

        title: Madagascar is on the brink of famine
        text: 'M ASY, A LISTLESS three-year-old, has just sucked up a packet of Plumpy’Nut,
            a peanut-butter paste that donors give to malnourished children. It may
            save her life. Yet her grandmother, Zemele, is still gloomy. Sitting on
            the ground outside a clinic in Maroalopoty, a village in southern Madagascar,
            she describes how hard life has become. Her land has had almost no rain
            for three years. Sandstorms have made the soil less fertile. Masy’s parents
            have gone away to find work. To make ends meet, Zemele has had to sell
            three of her four fields. “Before, it was bad,” she says, “but not so
            bad.”

            Madagascar, the world’s fourth-largest island, has long been prone to
            droughts, cyclones and floods. Now it is reeling from a double catastrophe:
            crop failure in the south, partly due to climate change, and a covid-19-induced
            economic crunch.


            On August 19th UN agencies appealed for $155m to help feed 1.3m people
            in southern Madagascar, where some areas are dangerously close to full-blown
            famine. Some families are so desperate they are selling their daughters,
            frets Mialy Radrianasolo of Unicef, the UN ’s agency for children. “Because
            of hunger,” she says, the poorest families “want to get rid” of their
            daughters, so a “man of 60” who may already have four or five wives “can
            get a 12-year-old in marriage.”


            Many children are dropping out of school to work or forage for food. Jean-Chrysostome
            Gege, the deputy head of a primary school in a village called Ehavo, says
            it had 250 pupils in 2018 but only 110 last year. Education may yield
            rich rewards eventually, but hungry households need food today.


            The emergency has many causes. Climate change has made the rains less
            reliable, say UN officials. In Madagascar’s deep south people have long
            been used to the keré (a drought that brings hunger). But in some places
            of late the keré has lasted for years instead of months. The UN says this
            one is the worst in 40 years.


            Covid-19, meanwhile, has clobbered the economy. Before the pandemic the
            World Bank expected GDP to grow by a healthy 5.2% in 2020; instead it
            shrank by 4.2%. This is even worse than it sounds, since the population
            is rising by 2.7% a year.


            Tourist contraction


            Moreover, GDP is expected to rebound slowly, with the IMF forecasting
            economic growth this year of just 3.2%. To defend Madagascar from the
            pandemic, the government has sealed it off, admitting only a handful of
            foreigners and allowing only a few flights to land. Tourists, who used
            to flock to see Madagascar’s lemur-filled rainforests or wild and unspoilt
            coast, cannot come. The estimated 1.5m people who depend on them are struggling.
            Noeline, who sells colourful wooden trucks by a road near Antananarivo,
            the capital, sold a dozen a day before the pandemic. Now she sells only
            one, she says.


            Malnutrition, though always a scourge, was until recently becoming rarer.
            The proportion of Malagasy children under five who are stunted fell from
            around 61% in 1992 to 42% in 2018, according to the World Bank. But it
            has jumped back up to 47%, says Unicef, and the rate of stunting is higher
            in the south.


            Small-bore solutions


            With 28m people in an area bigger than metropolitan France, Madagascar
            is not densely populated. But it is very poor. In the south, goods and
            people must move along rutted tracks rather than tarmac roads. The chopping
            down of trees for fuel has led to soil erosion. Some people are trying
            to reverse this. In Maroalopoty, a car that arrives from the UN Development
            Programme is rapidly surrounded by hundreds of villagers. The UN is recruiting
            them for a couple of dollars a day to plant lines of drought-resistant
            sisal to tamp down the earth and nearby sand dunes. For some, it will
            be too little, too late.


            Michel Saint-Lot of Unicef complains of decades of poor governance. “You
            cannot just drill small boreholes equipped with a hand pump for drinking
            water,” he says. The country needs long-term fixes, he argues, such as
            water pipelines for drinking water, cattle and irrigation.


            Soja Lahimaro, the governor of Androy, one of the worst-affected regions,
            says he used to think that governments in the far-away capital kept the
            south poor to show to foreigners, so they would dish out aid. Now he says
            that President Andry Rajoelina, who appointed him, is doing his best.


            Others have doubts. Mr Rajoelina has built costly stadiums and a Roman-style
            colosseum next to a historic palace in Antananarivo. He also wants to
            found a new city to relieve the capital of overcrowding. But education
            and health care remain woeful. When covid-19 struck Mr Rajoelina touted
            a herbal treatment called “Covid-Organics”, made from local plants. There
            is no evidence it works. He also initially spurned COVAX , the big global
            programme that gives free vaccines to poor countries. So far, less than
            1% of the population has had even one dose.


            Juvence Ramasy, an analyst, says Mr Rajoelina is a populist who makes
            promises but does not follow through. His grandly titled Initiative for
            the Emergence of Madagascar, which aims to promote mining and infrastructure,
            is still just a draft. Some public money has been spent in the south,
            says Mr Ramasy, but much of it has been stolen by politicians. The region
            is known as the “graveyard of projects”.


            Last week Mr Rajoelina went to Paris to woo foreign investors. It would
            help if his government quarrelled less with existing investors: for example,
            over a new airport terminal and two hydroelectric plants built by French
            companies. Reports after Mr Rajoelina met France’s president, Emmanuel
            Macron, on August 27th, suggest that these disputes may soon be settled.


            But some investors worry about Madagascar’s stability. Two decades ago
            it came close to civil war, and the army has intervened regularly in politics.
            Mr Rajoelina’s first term as president, from 2009 to 2014, was the result
            of a coup. He then won a reasonably fair election in 2018, but politics
            is far from calm. Recently the government arrested 27 people, including
            several military officers and two French citizens, who, it said, were
            planning to assassinate Mr Rajoelina. Details are unclear but police say
            one of the plotters asked a local oil company for $10m to overthrow the
            president, and promised oil concessions in return.


            The economy is riven with cronyism. Most media are controlled by pro-Rajoelina
            politicians. The opposition is weak. In May the Global Initiative on Transnational
            Organised Crime, an NGO based in Geneva, said that Madagascar was becoming
            a hub for heroin and cocaine trafficking. Local media ignored the story,
            complains Riana Raymonde Randrianarisoa, an investigative reporter. She
            believes the traffickers have high-level protection.


            Madagascar’s lean season starts in September. Without short-term aid many
            children will grow up with stunted bodies and stunted minds. To help families
            feed themselves in the long run, Madagascar needs to develop. Except for
            a few commercial farms, agriculture has barely begun to be mechanised.
            Only 15% of Malagasy have electricity; in the countryside, far fewer.
            At night villages like Zemele’s are almost pitch black. Worse, says Mr
            Ramasy, “nothing much is changing.”

        title: The global ambitions of Lebanon’s hard-pressed olive-oil makers
        text: 'I T BEGAN WITH a case of homesickness. Ibrahim El Kaakour missed his
            family’s olive groves in Baasir, so four years ago he gave up his engineering
            career abroad and returned to Lebanon. At the time farming was just a
            hobby for his family. But Mr Kaakour had a goal, to reinvigorate the groves—and
            Lebanon’s long-dormant olive-oil industry, which traces its roots all
            the way back to the Phoenicians. He launched Genco Olive Oil, named after
            Vito Corleone’s front company in “The Godfather”.

            Mr Kaakour is not alone. A short drive from Baasir lives Walid Mushantaf,
            who converted wheat fields into olive groves in 2010. Now the company
            he co-owns, Bustan El Zeitoun, grows Italian olive varieties (among others).
            Deeper in Lebanon’s mountains, Rose Bechara Perini’s firm, Darmmess SARL,
            grows the local souri variety on her extended family’s land. She calls
            Deir Mimas, her picturesque home town, the Bordeaux of olive oil.


            They all face the same challenge. Though olive oil was once a key ingredient
            in Lebanese cuisine, today locals don’t use it much. They prefer imported
            vegetable oil, which until recently was quite cheap thanks to the overvalued
            Lebanese pound. Meanwhile, the smallholder farmers who grow most of the
            country’s olives have let the quality of their product slip. The upshot
            is that the average Lebanese consumes 1.6kg of olive oil each year, a
            tenth of what the average Spaniard consumes.


            Lebanon’s long-running financial and economic crisis compounds the challenge.
            The country produces little, so nearly everything, from bottles to fertiliser,
            must be imported using dollars. As the Lebanese pound plunged in value,
            prices rose and dollars became scarce. There is also a shortage of fuel,
            which will be needed to run the olive presses once the annual harvest
            starts in September. And then there is the pandemic, which has ravaged
            restaurants, big buyers of extra-virgin olive oils.


            The drop in the pound has made imported vegetable oil costlier, which
            should help growers like Mr Kaakour. But he has his sights set on the
            international market. He wants to export high-end, extra-virgin olive
            oil, using olives from all over the country. Lebanese wine is a model.
            Before the 1970s, not much was exported. Then, during the civil war, Serge
            Hochar of Chateau Musar in Ghazir, near Beirut, started blending reds
            and selling them abroad. The brand took off after winning acclaim at the
            Bristol Wine Fair in 1979. Today about half of Lebanon’s wine is exported.


            Its olive-oil producers also believe they can compete with foreign heavyweights,
            such as Spain and Italy, in terms of quality, if not scale. The labels
            of Mr Kaakour, Mr Mushantaf and Ms Bechara Perini have won awards in international
            competitions. The founder of one of those competitions, Antonio Giuseppe
            Lauro, believes the Lebanese product is improving. Mr Kaakour hopes to
            make him and others an oil they can''t refuse.

        title: Kenya’s judges do their duty. A pity about its politicians
        text: 'B REAKING CONSTITUTIONS is often easier than making them. Kenya’s first
            two presidents, Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel arap Moi, took a hatchet to the
            one negotiated at independence from Britain in 1963. By the time the butchery
            ended, Kenya was a one-party state run by untouchable kleptocrats. Fixing
            the damage took decades. Under international and domestic pressure, Moi
            repealed the provision banning all parties but his own in 1991. But it
            took 19 more years of bitter struggle before Kenya again had a constitution
            worthy of the name.

            In recent years the hatchets have been out again. Kenya’s politicians
            finally accepted a new dispensation after post-election bloodshed claimed
            more than 1,000 lives in 2007-08. But the chastening effect of the violence
            did not last long. After another election controversy, in 2017, Uhuru
            Kenyatta, Kenya’s president (and Jomo’s son) joined forces with Raila
            Odinga, his rival-turned-sidekick, to push for yet another constitutional
            overhaul under the sweetly named Building Bridges Initiative ( BBI ).
            On August 20th Kenya’s Court of Appeal thwarted the initiative and granted
            the constitution from 2010 a reprieve.


            On the surface the BBI seemed a worthy enterprise. It was purported to
            be the glue that held the reconciliation between Messrs Kenyatta and Odinga
            (pictured, right and left) together. In 2017 the president secured re-election
            in a brace of contentious polls. Kenya teetered dangerously for months
            as Mr Odinga rejected the president’s initial victory, boycotted a court-ordered
            re-run and finally had himself sworn in as “the people’s president” before
            a baying mob of supporters. Nearly 100 people died in the accompanying
            political violence. The stand-off was defused only after the two rivals
            shook hands in March 2018 following secret talks. They have been inseparable
            ever since.


            Yet it was little more than political expediency that underpinned the
            reconciliation. For the president it defused a nasty crisis, shored up
            his iffy legitimacy and neutralised an opponent. Better still, it offered
            a handy opportunity to ditch his deputy president, William Ruto, whose
            uses had waned after he helped secure his boss a second term. Although
            Mr Ruto remains in office, he is clearly an outcast, his place in the
            sun now taken by the more malleable Mr Odinga. (The deputy president is
            all too familiar with the carousel of betrayal in Kenyan politics, having
            previously abandoned Mr Odinga for Mr Kenyatta.)


            Mr Odinga also benefited. After four failed bids for the presidency, he
            appears to have concluded that a share of power was better than none at
            all. More important, the president would now presumably back him rather
            than Mr Ruto as his successor in the election next August, when Mr Kenyatta
            is required to stand down.


            A deal built on rank expediency needed a cloak of respectability, however.
            Mr Odinga had to justify to his supporters his reconciliation with the
            man he accused of thrice cheating him. The BBI helped cover the stink.
            Kenya’s ethnic and political divisions could be presented not as man-made
            but the result of surmountable constitutional flaws. A popular initiative
            to fix these would usher in a new era of peace and prosperity and allow
            its architects to cast themselves as saviours.


            Kenyan civil society was appalled. However the politicians dressed it
            up, there was no popular clamour to alter the constitution. Nor was the
            initiative suggesting the odd tweak here and there. It would do real damage
            to the essence of the charter. The BBI would have altered 14 of its 18
            chapters, reckons Jerotich Seii, an activist who campaigned to stop it.


            Buried in the verbiage was what the activists considered the real purpose
            of the initiative: an expansion of executive power by creating the post
            of prime minister and two deputies. This would ease efforts by Messrs
            Odinga and Kenyatta to build an electable coalition by allowing them to
            dangle plum positions before the kingpins of smaller tribes.


            Kenya’s judges were quick to sense a stitch-up. In May the High Court
            sided with Ms Seii and her fellow plaintiffs, who argued that the BBI
            was a meretricious attempt to hoodwink the Kenyan people. The judges ruled
            that the constitution permitted amendments resulting from a popular initiative,
            but the BBI had clearly been driven by the president, not the people.
            On August 20th the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s judgment and
            put a halt to a referendum to enshrine the BBI ’s proposals into the constitution.
            Although there may yet be another appeal, Mr Odinga said he would accept
            the judgment and focus instead on next year’s election.


            Some good has come out of a tawdry process. Kenya’s judiciary, which ordered
            a re-run of the presidential election in 2017 over irregularities, has
            again shown its mettle. The constitution itself has proved resilient,
            while the judgment has made it harder for politicians to meddle with it.


            Bridges to nowhere


            If the BBI enhanced the reputation of Kenya’s judges, its politicians
            emerged with less credit. Mr Kenyatta had hoped to secure his legacy with
            a grandiose national-development strategy meant to reach full speed by
            the end of his term. It has largely stalled, partly because he chose instead
            to waste his efforts on a failed piece of opportunistic scheming. His
            ally seems equally damaged. During the president’s first term, Mr Odinga
            offered robust and often principled opposition. Given how readily it was
            sacrificed for the sake of ambition, such principle looks increasingly
            coincidental.


            If there is a political winner, it is Mr Ruto, who has noisily been thanking
            God for delivering Kenya from the disaster of the BBI . In reality the
            opposition he offered was tepid. Had the matter gone to a referendum,
            it is doubtful he would have led a “no” campaign. “It’s not worth expending
            political capital on,” a senior ally confided earlier this year.'

            a prisoner’s mouth. Across the road from La Piscine were offices used
            by the American government, which backed Mr Habré’s brutal regime.

            The despot who ruled Chad from 1982 to 1990 died on August 24th after
            contracting covid-19. He was 79, and serving a life sentence in Senegal
            for crimes against humanity.


            The son of a shepherd, Mr Habré showed early promise. He won a scholarship
            to study in France, where he earned a university degree. But on returning
            to Chad he joined a rebel group. In 1974 he and his men took three Europeans
            hostage, then killed a French officer sent to negotiate their release.
            Later that decade, under a power-sharing deal, he was given the posts
            of prime minister and vice-president. When the deal broke down, Mr Habré
            fled to Sudan. Several hundred skeletons were found near the house he
            left behind in Chad.


            He made a comeback in 1982, seizing power with the support of America,
            which saw him as a bulwark against communism and, in particular, Libya.
            America helped train Mr Habré’s secret police and sent him copious arms.
            President Ronald Reagan even invited him to the White House (pictured).
            France also helped out, sending troops. Meanwhile, Chadian soldiers massacred
            civilians. In all Mr Habré is thought to have ordered the killing of some
            40,000 people.


            Rebels led by Idriss Déby overthrew Mr Habré in 1990. For years the exiled
            leader lived a quiet, luxurious life in a coastal suburb of Dakar, the
            capital of Senegal. His victims, though, were rounding up evidence. “From
            the depths of that madness, I swore to fight for justice if I ever got
            out alive,” said Souleymane Guengueng, a former detainee.


            Finally, in 2015, Mr Habré was called before a special court in Senegal
            where 90 witnesses testified against him. Ten months later the judge found
            him guilty of crimes such as summary execution, torture and rape. A soft
            ululation from the widows of victims rang out in the courtroom, then cheering
            and weeping. It was a rare instance of a court in one country successfully
            prosecuting the former leader of another for crimes against humanity.


            America and France backed the Senegalese court, but in Chad their strategy
            did not change. Both threw their support behind Déby, who ruled with an
            iron fist for 30 years. After he was killed by rebels earlier this year,
            France endorsed his son, Mahamat, who took over in a coup. Stability was
            the priority, even if it left Chad in the same sorry state.'

        title: Uganda receives its first flight of evacuees from Afghanistan
        text: 'N O SOONER HAD the Taliban marched into Kabul than politicians in Uganda,
            a mere 5,000km away, were readying for the arrival of evacuees from Afghanistan.
            “The world will look at Uganda as a reliable partner,” explained one cabinet
            minister. Another said that evacuees would bring business for local hotels.
            A third joked, grotesquely, about how Ugandan men were praying for the
            safe landing of beautiful Afghan women.

            The first plane arrived at Entebbe airport on August 25th, carrying 51
            evacuees. Up to 2,000 are expected in the coming weeks. They will stay
            in hotels while American officials review their applications for resettlement
            in the United States and elsewhere, a process which could take months.
            Uganda is among two dozen countries, from Kosovo to Costa Rica, that have
            offered to take in Afghans temporarily; Rwanda is preparing to host the
            staff and student body of Afghanistan’s only all-girls boarding school.
            The welcome they have shown puts richer countries to shame, but their
            motives are not entirely altruistic.


            Uganda already hosts 1.5m refugees, more than any other country in Africa,
            with most coming from its troubled neighbours. Its openness draws on local
            traditions of welcome. Many Ugandans, including the president, Yoweri
            Museveni, know first-hand what it means to live in exile. But the country’s
            liberal approach, hailed by visiting dignitaries as a model for the world,
            also helps an authoritarian state to burnish its image and bring in money.
            Humanitarian aid provides rich pickings for contractors and officials.
            The arrival of the Afghans is a boon for hotels, emptied by the pandemic.
            America will foot the bill.


            For Mr Museveni, whose government is busy shutting down civil-society
            groups, the crisis is a chance to repair his deteriorating relationship
            with the West. In January he was declared the winner of an election, after
            opposition supporters were shot, abducted and tortured. The Biden administration
            described the process as “neither free nor fair” and imposed visa restrictions
            on Ugandan securocrats. By hosting Afghans, Mr Museveni is sending a reminder
            that he can be useful in cleaning up America’s mess. And not for the first
            time: since 2007 he has sent Ugandan soldiers to Somalia, itself once
            a scene of inglorious American retreat. There they battle Islamists with
            American training and arms.


            The use of African countries to process Afghan evacuees reflects “a growing
            pattern” of rich states shirking their responsibilities, says Achieng
            Akena of the International Refugee Rights Initiative, a non-profit group
            in Kampala. From 2013 Israel deported thousands of Eritrean and Sudanese
            asylum-seekers to Uganda and Rwanda, dumping them at the airport with
            $3,500 and no documents. The secret arrangements were long denied by the
            host countries. More transparently, the UN has evacuated asylum-seekers
            from Libyan detention centres to Rwanda and Niger. And this year Denmark
            passed a law that will allow it to deport asylum-seekers for processing
            in a third country, with Rwanda again rumoured as a possible destination.


            Historians recall that during the second world war the British government
            sent 7,000 Polish refugees to Uganda, where they stayed for several years.
            The new arrivals from Afghanistan will hope they are not left in limbo
            for so long. '

        title: Why Afghan officials have washed up in the United Arab Emirates
        text: 'F OR DAYS the world wondered where President Ashraf Ghani had gone
            as the Taliban advanced on Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. It was little
            surprise when he surfaced in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) on August
            18th. Mr Ghani joins a long list of former leaders who have sought shelter
            in the sunny Gulf state. Pervez Musharraf, a former Pakistani president,
            Thaksin Shinawatra, a former Thai prime minister, and Juan Carlos, Spain’s
            erstwhile king, are all thought to call the UAE home.

            Most of these leaders left their countries under a cloud. Mr Musharraf
            was convicted of treason for abrogating and suspending Pakistan’s constitution
            in 2007. Thaksin Shinawatra was convicted of corruption committed while
            prime minister. Juan Carlos is accused of dodgy dealing with Saudi Arabia.
            And Mr Ghani (pictured) has been criticised for cutting and running, though
            he denies reports that he left Kabul with millions of dollars in cash.
            In a video posted on Facebook he said he fled “with one set of traditional
            clothes, a vest and the sandals I was wearing.”


            Other Afghan officials planned ahead: they are suspected of having moved
            hundreds of millions of dollars from Kabul to Dubai, the UAE ’s financial
            hub, over the years. A former vice-president, Ahmad Zia Masood, once flew
            to Dubai with $52m (£38m) in cash, according to American diplomatic cables.
            (The average yearly income in Afghanistan is around $500.) Some of this
            money has gone towards real estate. Sher Khan Farnood, the late chairman
            of Kabul Bank (and high-stakes poker player), reportedly owned dozens
            of properties on the ritzy Palm Jumeirah in Dubai—or, at least, his name
            was on the property records. He gave loans to associates of Hamid Karzai,
            a former Afghan president, for the purchase of villas in the emirate.
            “What I’m doing is not proper, not exactly what I should do,” Farnood
            told the Washington Post in 2010. “But this is Afghanistan.”


            Just as important, it is Dubai, which takes a relaxed attitude towards
            dirty money. The UAE scores poorly on an index of money-laundering risk
            put together by the Basel Institute on Governance. That has made it the
            bane of foreign governments trying to tackle corruption—but a preferred
            haven for money-launderers, arms-smugglers and shady officials. Stable
            and secure, Dubai usually benefits when capital takes flight from more
            volatile parts of the region. Afghan officials are not the first to show
            up with suitcases full of cash. Baathists from Iraq rushed there when
            America invaded in 2003. So did relatives of Syria’s blood-soaked president,
            Bashar al-Assad, in 2012.


            Fugitives and political exiles who wash up in the UAE assume they can
            live safe, secluded (often luxurious) lives. “There’s no paparazzi—no
            one’s going to hunt you down,” says a former resident. More importantly,
            the country is not known for aiding international pursuits of justice.
            Extraditions are rare and prosecutions for financial impropriety abroad
            even rarer. The UAE does have an extradition treaty with Afghanistan,
            but it might not be respected should the Taliban make a request. South
            Africa has waited years for the UAE to help deliver the Gupta brothers,
            who are accused of corruption and said to be living in Dubai. The countries
            signed an extradition treaty this year. South Africa is still waiting.
            (The Guptas deny wrongdoing.)


            In return for a welcome, the UAE often gets influence. Some exiles, such
            as Muhammad Dahlan, a Palestinian, find seats in the court of Muhammad
            Bin Zayed, the UAE ’s crown prince and de facto ruler. Prince Muhammad
            “keeps joker cards to play in key geographies”, says a former Emirati
            official. Mr Dahlan, who alienated both of Palestine’s main parties, helps
            with diplomacy in Serbia, Ethiopia and Israel. High-profile refugees also
            broadcast the attractions of the UAE . “They serve as a signal that it
            is, by and large, a safe haven for the international grey and black markets,”
            says Christopher Davidson, an expert on the Gulf states. “It provides
            a bolthole for the world’s shadow elite.”


            Sometimes the UAE seems to harbour political fugitives and exiled leaders
            in order to gain leverage or curry favour with America, a key ally. Mr
            Ghani, says the foreign ministry, was accepted on humanitarian grounds.
            Fair enough: when the Taliban last seized power they tortured, castrated
            and murdered one of his predecessors. His warm welcome may also be a shot
            at Qatar, a rival of the UAE . Back in the 1990s the UAE was one of only
            three countries to recognise the Taliban’s rule over Afghanistan (and
            was rewarded with cash flows from the poppy harvest). But more recently
            the Taliban and other Islamist exiles found a home in Qatar, which the
            UAE accuses of supporting extremism.'

        title: Israel’s prime minister gets a hard lesson in pandemic politics
        text: 'J UST TWO months ago, in early June, cases of covid-19 were waning
            in Israel. With one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, the
            country seemed to be nearly done with the virus. Masks were discarded
            and restrictions lifted. But the end was illusory. The spread of the Delta
            variant has caused a spike in new cases. More than 8,000 were logged on
            August 17th.

            The Delta variant may have entered Israel before Naftali Bennett became
            prime minister on June 13th, but he has taken a beating over his handling
            of the outbreak. The government “received the country in the best state
            in the world in regard to coronavirus”, says Binyamin Netanyahu, who preceded
            Mr Bennett and is now leader of the opposition. The prime minister, says
            Mr Netanyahu, has spoiled that success.


            Mr Netanyahu’s criticism is self-serving, but for much of July he did
            call on the government to give Israelis a third dose of the vaccine. On
            July 29th the government said it would do just that, jabbing those over
            60 for a third time—the first country to do so. It has since broadened
            the policy to those over 50. Some restrictions have also been renewed,
            such as limits on the size of indoor and outdoor gatherings.


            Early data suggest the new jabs do indeed offer more protection from infection.
            Officials hope they will reduce pressure on hospitals. Mr Bennett is desperate
            to avoid another lockdown, claiming that the three previous ones, under
            Mr Netanyahu, had “a direct price in human lives”. The prime minister
            also fears that Israelis may not abide by a fourth lockdown.


            Israelis are already souring on Mr Bennett. According to a recent poll,
            43% of them think Mr Netanyahu did a better job of handling the pandemic.
            Only 21% favoured Mr Bennett. His party, Yamina, was never all that popular.
            It won just seven seats (out of 120) in the last election. But the coalition
            opposed to Mr Netanyahu needed Yamina to form a government, so Mr Bennett
            was offered the top job for two years in order to gain his support.


            As part of the coalition agreement, Mr Bennett cannot remove or discipline
            ministers of other parties. That includes nearly all senior cabinet ministers,
            most of whom have left Mr Bennett to fend for himself when it comes to
            the pandemic. Erstwhile rivals, such as Yair Lapid, the foreign minister,
            and Avigdor Lieberman, the finance minister, rarely attend meetings of
            the “coronavirus cabinet”.


            Mr Bennett is largely to blame for the pressure he is under. In 2020 he
            positioned himself as Mr Netanyahu’s chief critic, even writing a book,
            “How to Beat Covid-19”, in which he confidently explained how Israel could
            adopt a “zero infections” policy. In July he promised to rid the country
            of the virus in five weeks. Now, though, he is resorting to word games.
            He has largely stopped saying “coronavirus” in public, preferring “the
            Delta virus”, in order to convince voters that he is facing an entirely
            new challenge.


            Mr Bennett says, “The pandemic is teaching the whole world a lesson in
            humility.” Yet he hasn’t stopped personalising the fight against covid-19,
            much as Mr Netanyahu did. On August 17th he celebrated the fact that a
            million Israelis had got a third jab, calling it “an expression of trust”
            in himself. If this wave begins to dwindle soon, Mr Bennett can claim
            that, unlike Mr Netanyahu, he succeeded without resorting to a lockdown.
            But if cases continue to rise, he may find himself even more isolated.
            Health experts are watching the outbreak closely. Politicians are, too.

        title: Shia zealots try to cancel a statue of Baghdad’s founder
        text: 'T HEY WERE inspired by activists in America and Britain who toppled
            statues of Confederate soldiers and 18th-century slave-traders. Their
            target was 1,000 years older, however. Shia radicals in Iraq want to tear
            down a bust of Abu Jaafar al-Mansur, which sits on a pedestal in Baghdad
            (pictured). Mansur, the second Abbasid caliph, who ruled from 754 to 775
            AD , created a vast empire and founded Baghdad itself, which he called
            the “City of Peace”. For a while it was the greatest city in the world.

            But Mansur is remembered by some as a Sunni tyrant who treated Shias more
            brutally than Saddam Hussein or the jihadists of Islamic State. He is
            said to have ordered the poisoning of Imam Jaafar al-Sadiq, the sixth
            of 12 imams revered by Shias. This recently led to small protests at the
            statue and calls for its destruction. “The continued existence of this
            statue in Baghdad is a disgrace, and we can only regain some honour when
            it is demolished,” reads a statement by Yasser al-Habib, an influential
            Shia cleric based in England.


            Historians are aghast. “To reduce Mansur to a base sectarian figure is
            a travesty,” says Justin Marozzi, author of a fine history of Baghdad.
            Mansur did fill crypts with Shia skulls in an effort to eliminate competition
            to Abbasid rule. Both the Abbasids and the Shias claimed legitimacy by
            tracing their lineage back to the Prophet Muhammad. But Mansur also turned
            Baghdad into a hub of science, culture and religion, leading to Islam’s
            “golden age”.


            In 2005 Mansur’s bust was knocked off its perch by a bomb, raising sectarian
            tension. To avoid a repeat, security forces dispersed the recent protests
            around the monument. Social-media posts about Mr Habib’s statement were
            banned and bystanders photographing the statue detained. President Barham
            Salih tried to mollify Sunni imams at the tomb of Abu Hanifa, an important
            place of worship for Sunnis that the radicals also threatened to destroy.


            Most Iraqis seem to be fed up with attempts to divide them along sectarian
            lines, often by politicians trying to shift attention from their own failures.
            The call to destroy the statue was not taken up by Shia militias. Youth
            groups from the Shias’ holy city of Najaf even offered to defend it as
            “a symbol of Iraqi heritage”. And this ecumenical spirit may be spreading.
            Iraq’s prime minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, a Shia, has called on leaders
            from countries spanning the Sunni-Shia divide, such as Saudi Arabia and
            Iran, to gather for a summit at the end of the month. The venue, of course,
            would be Baghdad, Mansur’s city of peace.'

        title: Rich countries want to strike trade deals in Africa
        text: '“W E WILL BE the guinea pig,” said Uhuru Kenyatta, Kenya’s president,
            before trade talks with America opened last year. A deal would make Kenya
            only the second African country after Morocco to sign a free-trade agreement
            with the United States. Officials in the Trump administration called the
            proposed deal “a model” for future ones. But such bilateral talks jar
            with Africa’s push for regional integration and with President Joe Biden’s
            emphasis on multilateralism. Negotiations are now on hold while America
            works out what to do next.

            The pause reflects a sense of drift in Africa’s trade relations with the
            West, as both America and Europe rethink how they do business with the
            continent. In the past they granted concessions, such as lower tariffs
            on African exports, without requiring African countries to reciprocate.
            Now they are increasingly looking to negotiate two-way agreements which
            will open up African markets, too. The old approach was paternalistic
            and gave Africans little say. But the new one, handled badly, could put
            Africa’s own integration at risk.


            Since 2000 American policy has been built around the African Growth and
            Opportunity Act ( AGOA ), which grants duty-free access to thousands of
            products exported from around 40 eligible countries. It was a law passed
            by Congress, not a treaty negotiated between governments, so African countries
            have no control over the eligibility criteria. That creates friction.
            Rwanda, for example, was partially suspended in 2018 because its ban on
            imported second-hand clothes, intended to boost local production, irked
            the American firms that export them.


            Now African countries must wait anxiously to see if Congress will extend
            AGOA beyond its current expiry date in 2025. The uncertainty makes business
            “too unpredictable”, sighs a Ugandan technocrat. Kenya’s push for a fully
            fledged trade deal with America is an attempt to seize the initiative.
            It also draws on the promise of AGOA itself, which was always envisaged
            as a stepping stone towards negotiated pacts.


            But there is a snag. Kenya is part of the East African Community, which
            is, on paper, a customs union. If Kenya were to lower barriers to American
            products, then the other five countries in the bloc would either have
            to let those products leak into their own markets or tighten border checks
            to keep them out. Negotiating with countries as a group, rather than individually,
            would be a less divisive way forward.


            Whoever is at the table, many American businesses now favour moving away
            from AGOA -like trade concessions and towards reciprocal agreements. They
            do not want to “lose out” while other countries strike deals, says Witney
            Schneidman, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs.
            For instance, a refrigerator made in America enters South Africa with
            a far higher tariff than one made in the EU , notes Mr Schneidman.


            Meanwhile European countries are stuck in a quagmire of their own. They
            once gave preferential access to exports from their former colonies in
            Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. That clashed with World Trade Organisation
            rules. So in 2000 the EU started touting reciprocal deals called “economic
            partnership agreements”, negotiated with regional blocs. Britain is adopting
            a similar model in its post-Brexit trade with Africa.


            A southern African pact with the EU came into force in 2016. But countries
            such as Nigeria (in the west African bloc) and Tanzania (in the east)
            have refused to sign deals in their respective regions. They worry, with
            some justification, that dropping tariffs would expose nascent industries
            to a flood of European competition.


            The incentive to cut a deal with Europe is also undermined by existing
            systems of trade preferences, which overlap like onion skins. Peel off
            one layer, as the EU is doing, and countries like Kenya lose access to
            European markets—unless they sign up for an economic partnership agreement.
            But poorer countries such as Tanzania can export duty-free without a deal,
            thanks to a different layer of benefits. Unsurprisingly the two neighbours
            in the same east African bloc find themselves at odds.


            Yet the whole continent is supposed to be pursuing its own ambitious agenda
            for integration. This year 37 countries started the gradual process of
            trading under an African Continental Free Trade Area ( A f CFTA ). They
            want to kick-start Africa’s stalled industrialisation by selling manufactured
            goods to each other, rather than raw materials to distant continents.
            Kenya’s solo negotiations with America “may undermine the A f CFTA ”,
            says Prudence Sebahizi, the African Union’s chief technical adviser on
            the pact. He fears that American goods may displace African ones in Kenya’s
            market.


            Influential voices urge a rethink. “Rich countries should not be picking
            African integration apart,” says David Luke of the London School of Economics.
            Carlos Lopes, the African Union’s representative on future relations with
            Europe, suggests trade talks with the rest of the world could wait until
            the A f CFTA is embedded and Africa is ready to negotiate as a single
            bloc.


            Others think that strategy unrealistic. An EU official says Europe shares
            the vision of an Africa that “can speak with one voice”. But the best
            way to get there, he says, is to build on existing deals. The A f CFTA
            is still being assembled. “It’s only when we get an African customs union
            that Africa can negotiate as a bloc,” says Trudi Hartzenberg of the Trade
            Law Centre, a South African think-tank, “and that’s a long way off.” Free-trade
            areas can, and do, overlap.'

        title: The task facing Zambia’s new president, Hakainde Hichilema
        text: 'O VER THE past four years new presidents in southern Africa have taken
            office amid masses of hype. Emmerson Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe would be
            open for business. João Lourenço vowed to diversify Angola’s oil-dependent
            economy. Cyril Ramaphosa pledged a “new dawn” in South Africa after years
            of graft. They have all disappointed.

            So there are grounds for caution about the triumph of Hakainde Hichilema
            (pictured), who on August 16th was declared the winner of Zambia’s presidential
            election. But there are also reasons to be optimistic about the former
            businessman, who failed in five previous attempts at winning the presidency.
            This time he gained 58% of the vote, enough to render moot efforts to
            rig the poll by the outgoing president, Edgar Lungu. Unlike most presidents
            in southern Africa, Mr Hichilema is not a product of a decadent post-colonial
            ruling party. He is more a liberal than a liberationist. And he has a
            plan.


            “At the core of my politics”, says Mr Hichilema, “is a belief that Zambia
            has the potential to become a successful middle-income country.” Today
            the country has a GDP per person of less than $1,000, or one-eighth that
            of next-door Botswana. Under Mr Lungu corruption exploded while living
            standards fell.


            Improving them first requires getting Zambia out of a macroeconomic hole.
            Public debt as a share of GDP rose from 66% to 113% while Mr Lungu was
            in charge. The government stopped paying many foreign creditors. Fiscal
            incontinence meant less money was spent on services for the poor. It also
            contributed to a weakening of the currency. Since most food is imported,
            the decline in the kwacha led to higher prices.


            Mr Hichilema’s government will turn to the IMF for help. It will pledge
            reforms as part of a formal programme which will bring with it a cheap
            loan. An agreement with the fund should also pave the way for a deal on
            restructuring Zambia’s external debts under a scheme known as the Common
            Framework introduced in April by the G 20 group of countries.


            The framework is a response to changing times. When African countries
            had debts forgiven in the 2000s, these were mostly to rich countries or
            multilateral institutions. Today African countries owe more money to Chinese
            state banks and private bondholders in the West. Before the creditors
            accept new terms, they need to be convinced that they will be treated
            equally; that the hard-up government will not rob Peter to pay Pang, or
            vice versa.


            Zambia may therefore be a test of whether the framework can help poor
            countries. (It is also being used in Chad and Ethiopia.) During the Lungu
            era, Western-based investment funds, which hold about 40% of Zambia’s
            external debt, felt that they were being treated badly compared with Chinese
            lenders, which account for about 30%. Though an agreement will depend
            on China’s willingness to co-operate, Western bondholders are optimistic
            that Mr Hichilema will strike a deal which treats everyone equally.


            The president-elect also wants to revive mining. Zambia is Africa’s second-largest
            copper producer. Prices for the metal are high, hovering around levels
            last seen during the commodities boom of the 2000s and early 2010s. But
            previous governments’ policies of expropriation and high taxes meant there
            have been no new large mining projects for a decade. Mr Hichilema wants
            to change that by lowering taxes and protecting property rights.


            The danger, as ever when a pragmatist replaces a populist, is that cleaning
            up the mess takes time and can cause short-term hardship. Zambians are
            cheered by Mr Hichilema’s promise to respect human rights after Mr Lungu’s
            abuses. But they cannot eat civil liberties. So there is a role for rich
            countries to play in offering aid and nudging debt talks along. Otherwise
            Western diplomats celebrating Mr Hichilema’s victory may find that his
            popularity swoons.


            Zambia has long been a pioneer for African democracy. In 1991 and 2011
            it voted out an incumbent president. In doing so again, it has given the
            continent another lesson in democracy. It now falls to Mr Hichilema to
            show how to run a country. '

        title: A fraudster’s confession rebounds on Nigeria’s top cop
        text: 'I T IS AN Instagram account to inspire envy. In one picture Ramon Abbas,
            a Nigerian who calls himself “Hushpuppi”, is leaning against a white Rolls-Royce.
            In another the Roller is purple. Lest his 2.5m followers think he is partial
            only to palatial British cars, other posts show him with a red Ferrari
            and sporting a red Chanel handbag or lounging in a private jet (pictured
            above).

            Nowhere on Hushpuppi’s feed is there a picture showing him in handcuffs
            being led away by police in Dubai. Nor of the $40m in cash that they seized
            in raids on several apartments there before handing him over to America’s
            Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) to face charges of money-laundering
            and cybercrimes.


            Few were surprised when they learned that Hushpuppi had pleaded guilty
            in April. But Nigerians were stunned on July 28th when court documents
            were unsealed implicating their most famous cop, Abba Kyari, who is known
            for tracking down and locking up kidnappers, of whom Nigeria has far too
            many. Mr Kyari is now himself wanted by the law, oddly enough for locking
            up one of Hushpuppi’s accomplices. In this case, though, it was not sleuthing
            that got Mr Kyari his man. The indictment alleges that Hushpuppi promised
            to pay him for the arrest.


            The plot began, according to the indictment, with a wheeze to swindle
            $1.1m out of a businessman who wanted a loan to build a school in Qatar,
            by impersonating bankers and setting up a fake bank website. Of the money
            raked in, $230,000 was spent on a watch that was hand-delivered to Hushpuppi
            in Dubai.


            But then the thieves fell out over the size of the cut going to Kelly
            Chibuzo Vincent, whose job it had been to set up the fake bank website.
            Feeling cheated, Mr Vincent called the businessman and told him of the
            scam. Hushpuppi, furious, allegedly offered the Nigerian detective money
            to arrest Mr Vincent and give him the “beating of his life”. Job done,
            Mr Kyari, a deputy commissioner of police, took photos of the arrested
            man and sent them as proof—along with details of a bank account into which
            payment could be made.


            Mr Kyari insists he is innocent and said he arrested Mr Vincent only because
            he had threatened to kill members of Hushpuppi’s family in Nigeria. He
            denies accepting money. But an affidavit submitted by the FBI , backed
            up by messages between cop and fraudster, showed that Mr Kyari was told
            to hold Vincent until the scam was completed and that he had asked for
            a cut of the profits. Mr Kyari allegedly received some $20,000 for his
            role.


            Unusually for an organisation that often overlooks wrongdoing by its officers,
            Nigeria’s police force has suspended Mr Kyari and opened an investigation.
            Nigerians gripe that cops are more likely to try to extort money from
            them than to respond to distress calls. In 2005 a former police chief,
            Tafa Balogun, pleaded guilty to money-laundering and was made to forfeit
            16bn naira ($120m), several houses and a “jeep farm” with hundreds of
            pricey cars. Shortly after the seizures the recovered loot vanished and
            the houses and cars were auctioned off for peanuts to cronies, prompting
            parliamentarians to demand that Mike Okiro, Mr Balogun’s successor, account
            for the looted loot.


            Mr Kyari’s indictment may not be the biggest scandal to hit the police.
            But it is demoralising for the public. His heroics in battling kidnappers
            had earned him a presidential medal of courage and made him unusually
            popular for a policeman. His fall would be a blow to the many who saw
            him as proof that a cop can rise to the top by working hard and staying
            clean. Perhaps he may have been too good to be true. '

        title: Why Mozambique invited foreign troops to fight its jihadists
        text: 'M OCíMBOA DA PRAIA has been at the centre of Mozambique’s war against
            jihadists. For years the town in the north-eastern province of Cabo Delgado
            has been home to aggrieved Muslims from the Mwani ethnic group, angry
            at how the mostly Catholic Makonde elite dominate politics and business.
            The port was also a hub for people, ideas and goods—Islamists from across
            east Africa, fundamentalism and, later, money and guns. In October 2017,
            when an Islamic sect turned violent, it was the site of the first battle
            of a conflict that has cost at least 3,200 lives and displaced 800,000
            people. The insurgency then grew. Jihadists seized Mocímboa da Praia in
            August last year. From there they plotted an attack in March on Palma,
            80km along the coast, which led to the shelving of a nearby gas project
            that the government had hoped would transform the economy.

            Many Mozambicans therefore cheered when, on August 8th, Mocímboa da Praia
            was reclaimed. Whether this marks the beginning of the end for the group
            known locally as al-Shabab (like the unrelated Somali group) is unclear.
            What is certain is that the operation led by the Rwanda Defence Force
            ( RDF ) reflects how a locally rooted conflict is internationalising.


            Filipe Nyusi, Mozambique’s president, has been criticised for a slow and
            weak response to the insurgents. But since the golden goose that is the
            liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) project waddled off, he has been more purposeful.
            In April he visited Paul Kagame, Rwanda’s president, in Kigali. A Rwandan
            army reconnaissance team visited Mozambique the next month. A 1,000-strong
            RDF force arrived in July.


            Opponents of Messrs Nyusi and Kagame speculate that France is footing
            the bill. They note that Emmanuel Macron visited Mr Kagame a month after
            Mr Nyusi. The French president also received the two African leaders in
            Paris, where the Mozambican leader met the boss of Total, the French energy
            firm in charge of the LNG project. Nonsense, say the French. “We are covering
            all our own costs,” says Ronald Rwivanga, an RDF spokesman.


            Rwanda is in some ways an attractive ally for Mr Nyusi. He had been reluctant
            to invite soldiers from the Southern African Development Community ( SADC
            ), which worries about insecurity spreading across the region. SADC troops
            were deployed only on August 9th. He does not want to be beholden to South
            Africa, the regional big power and provider of most of the mission’s manpower
            (it has authorised the use of 1,495 personnel). The RDF is battle-hardened
            and highly disciplined. South Africa’s army has faced years of austerity.


            For Mr Kagame the mission has several aims. Kigali and Maputo are roughly
            the same distance (1,700km) from Pemba, the provincial capital of Cabo
            Delgado. Rwanda is worried that jihadism in eastern Congo and northern
            Mozambique could metastasise. Rwanda is also short of friends, a result
            of hunting down enemies in other countries and backing rebels in its neighbourhood.
            Helping Mozambique gains Rwanda a new ally. And it pleases America, Britain
            and France. The presence of Rwandan dissidents in Mozambique may have
            played a small role in the decision, too. On May 23rd Cassien Ntamuhanga,
            a Rwandan journalist and asylum-seeker, was arrested in Mozambique, reportedly
            in the presence of someone speaking Rwanda’s main language. He has not
            been seen since. (Rwanda denies any knowledge of the incident.)


            It is unclear how Rwandans and Mozambicans will work with a SADC contingent
            that also includes Angolans, Botswanans and Zimbabweans. Mozambique says
            it is in charge, yet the RDF has taken the lead, much to the delight of
            propagandists accompanying it. “Covering RDF in combat is like going to
            a Mike Tyson fight, in his prime,” tweeted one sycophant. Tanzania, whose
            main city, Dar es Salaam, is just 700km from Pemba, has been wary of involvement.
            In the past it had close links with its southern neighbour. But during
            the presidency of John Magufuli, who died in March, the insurgency strained
            relations. Mozambicans complain that Tanzania fuels the violence (funding
            and some fighters come over the border). Tanzanians accuse the Mozambicans
            of a botched response. Frosty relations make it harder to fight an insurgency
            that takes advantage of a fluid frontier. Tanzania’s new president, Samia
            Suluhu Hassan, may prove more co-operative. Western countries are keen
            on upgrading Mozambican forces. America will soon conduct its second training
            mission. The EU is finalising its plan, led by Portugal. Britain has offered
            similar help. France has proposed maritime co-operation. The West may
            be asked to fund some of the Africans’ military response. Should that
            happen, they ought to press Mr Nyusi on his strategy. The insurgents have
            not been vanquished. The ease with which the RDF marched on Mocímboa da
            Praia suggests they retreated to the bush rather than fight. Analysts
            reckon that the group may change its plans, spreading out across northern
            Mozambique and adopting guerrilla tactics.


            The way the offensive has unfolded indicates that Mr Nyusi’s priority
            is to resuscitate the LNG project. The RDF has retaken key towns and secured
            roads to the gas infrastructure. Mozambique hopes that Total will return
            in 2022.


            The danger is that a narrow focus on the gas project does not address
            the root causes of the conflict. So long as the people of Cabo Delgado
            see few benefits from the development of local natural resources, and
            see a state unable to provide health care, education, jobs and security,
            grievances will fester. Last year Mr Nyusi announced a new northern development
            agency. But some worry it is just a sop to donors.


            Across Africa attempts to crush extremism through military means alone
            have often failed. The international response may bring back the gas companies.
            But will it help the people? '

        title: Ghana plans to buy back oil licences no one wants
        text: 'I T WAS NOT meant to be this way. Ghana made its first big oil discovery
            only in 2007, a generation after its corruption-addled and environmentally
            damaged regional peers. But the expected bonanza of investment and revenue
            has failed to materialise. ExxonMobil, an oil company, quit this year
            without drilling a well. Total decided to pass altogether. Chinese firms
            have gone elsewhere. Now the nominally centre-right and pro-market government
            plans to step in and buy back the oilfields no one else wants.

            On August 6th Parliament voted to support plans by Matthew Prempeh, the
            energy minister, to pay up to $1.1bn to acquire large stakes in Deepwater
            Tano-Cape Three Points ( DWT - CTP ) and South Deepwater Tano ( SDWT ).
            The two oil blocks are more than 100km offshore and in deep water. Both
            have discoveries of oil, but neither is in development, still less production.


            Mr Prempeh says the fields could produce 200,000 barrels per day within
            four years, more than double Ghana’s dwindling output. “Oil majors are
            shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy,” he complains. Without
            new foreign investment, Ghana had two choices. It could leave the oil
            and gas in the ground or get involved in the production game. The deal
            will create jobs, he says, and return a handsome profit.


            It is also a great deal for Norwegian shipping billionaire Kjell Inge
            Røkke, who controls Aker Energy and AGM , two oil firms with stakes in
            the blocks. Mr Røkke’s firms acquired a 50% stake in DWT - CTP in 2018
            for just $100m. A year later, he persuaded the government to relinquish
            a 14% stake in SDWT , arguing it would make the licences more attractive
            to the potential partners that never materialised. Last September, Mr
            Røkke himself said it was time to “move focus” to renewables, and in May
            hinted at withdrawing from Ghana.


            Bright Simons, an activist, says the government has overvalued the blocks
            and is buying licences that might otherwise have been relinquished anyhow.
            Industry sources say the biggest beneficiaries may be the well-connected
            local firms that will expect to win contracts if exploration takes off.
            The Energy Committee took just a day to consider the minister’s request,
            and Parliament barely two hours to rubber stamp the minister’s request
            to negotiate the purchase. Perhaps it ought to take more time when the
            deal comes back for ratification.'

        title: Mohamed Bazoum, Niger’s new president, asks for help
        text: 'S INCE A WAVE of anti-French protests broke out last year across parts
            of the Sahel, few leaders in the region have wanted to appear to be too
            chummy with the former colonial power, or for that matter any of the Western
            countries which have sent troops to help fight jihadists. Mohamed Bazoum,
            who was sworn in as president of Niger in April in its first democratic
            transfer of power, is less standoffish. He not only welcomes the French
            military presence in his country, but thinks other Western powers should
            be doing far more to help roll back the insurgent groups that have overrun
            parts of Mali and are causing havoc in Burkina Faso, Niger and Nigeria.

            “We are not satisfied with the international community as a whole in its
            way of fighting terrorism in this area,” Mr Bazoum (pictured) tells The
            Economist. “Against the same adversary, Daesh [Islamic State], in Iraq
            we saw a great international coalition. But today, we are not seeing the
            same mobilisation through the UN , in particular.” The region has enough
            troops, and these are being trained and advised by French and allied forces.
            But it lacks air power and the money to pay its men, which the UN could
            provide, he says.


            Niger, which is ranked as the world’s poorest country across a range of
            measures by the UN Development Programme, is caught between two jihadist
            insurgencies. Along its western borders with Mali and Burkina Faso it
            faces groups such as the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara ( ISGS )
            and Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin ( JNIM ), which is linked to al-Qaeda.
            The number of attacks mounted by these and allied groups will increase
            by a third this year, predicts the Africa Centre for Strategic Studies,
            part of America’s Department of Defence.


            On current trends the conflict will lead to more than 2,400 deaths in
            the Sahel this year. In Niger’s east, meanwhile, the government is battling
            the jihadists of Boko Haram who attack across the border from safe areas
            in Nigeria or from the marshes of Lake Chad. Roughly 500,000 people are
            living in camps in Niger because of violence in the country or its neighbours.


            Mr Bazoum’s response has been to host the headquarters of a French-led
            counter-terrorism operation, known as the Takuba Task Force, which will
            include commandos from nine European countries and will focus on training
            and advising local forces. This is meant to become the leading Western
            effort in the Sahel as France winds down its own counter-terrorism force,
            Operation Barkhane, which currently has about 5,000 troops deployed in
            the Sahel and has its headquarters in Chad. Yet improving Niger’s security
            will depend on whether its neighbours restore stability. “If Malian territory
            is at the mercy of terrorist groups, as is the case today...our situation
            will remain difficult,” he says.


            Within Niger Mr Bazoum is not just relying on force. He hopes to deal
            with the discontent that leads some to join the insurgents. To win people
            over he is trying to provide services such as clinics, clean water and
            schools in remote villages, and to attract investment by curbing corruption.
            Investments in infrastructure and solar energy are aimed at boosting growth
            and output, particularly on farms. Mr Bazoum is also aiming to slow the
            world’s fastest rate of population growth by building boarding schools
            for girls, with the aim of keeping them in education until they are 18
            years old. Currently, many leave school at 13 and are married within a
            year. By 18 many will already have two babies, he says, contributing to
            a “crazy” fertility rate of almost seven births per woman.


            Improving governance and education will take time. Yet if Niger is left
            unaided, time may not be on its side. '

        title: A flood of vaccines for Tunisia as foreigners vie for influence
        text: 'W HAT A DIFFERENCE a month makes. In July, during the Eid al-Adha holiday,
            Tunisia’s health minister opened covid-19 vaccine centres to all adults.
            The centres were blindsided by his announcement. Large crowds queued for
            hours, only to be turned away when doses ran out.

            The shambles was emblematic of the government’s failure to deal with the
            pandemic. By August 7th just 17% of Tunisia’s 12m people had received
            at least one dose. Though case numbers have fallen from their peak in
            July, the death rate, more than 10 per 1m people, ranks among the world’s
            worst. Hospitals are full.


            On August 8th, though, the government called Tunisians back for another
            drive. This time workers jabbed more than 551,000 arms—almost 5% of the
            population—in a single day. Two things had changed since the botched earlier
            attempt.


            First was the arrival of millions of doses from abroad. Saudi Arabia sent
            1m last month and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) 500,000 more. America
            delivered 1m doses of the Moderna jab. France, Tunisia’s former colonial
            ruler, sent 1m as well. All told Tunisia has received 6m doses, says the
            president, Kais Saied, enough to fully vaccinate a quarter of its people.


            Second was Mr Saied’s decision to assume emergency powers on July 25th,
            when he sacked the prime minister and suspended parliament. It is unclear
            if he will return power to parliament, call for talks with politicians,
            unions and other groups or take further steps, such as calling a referendum
            to change the political system. The glut of vaccines and the political
            upheaval are related: both are reflections of a struggle for influence
            in the only country where democracy took root after the Arab spring.


            Many Tunisians, fed up with their moribund economy, have greeted the president’s
            self-coup with cheers or shrugs. GDP shrank by 8.6% last year. Unemployment
            is 18%—and 30% for graduates. Parliament was paralysed by petty squabbles.


            Saudi Arabia and the UAE , for their part, are enthusiastic. They have
            long been unhappy about the influence of Ennahda, a moderate Islamist
            party with the largest bloc of seats in parliament, and have sought to
            undermine it. Television channels in the UAE , for example, devote ample
            airtime to Abir Moussi, a demagogue who rails against Islamists (she ran
            for president in 2019 but won just 4% of the vote).


            Neither country has much influence in far-off Tunisia, which has limited
            ties to the Gulf. But both see an opportunity to gain some thanks to the
            pandemic and the resulting economic crisis. Since Mr Saied sidelined parliament
            both the Saudi foreign minister and an adviser to the UAE ’s president
            have visited him to show their support. Many Tunisians believe they dangled
            the prospect of further aid.


            Western countries worry Mr Saied will weaken Tunisia’s democracy, but
            seem unsure how to react. Since 2011 the EU has sent Tunisia more than
            €2bn in grants. America has given more than $1bn, and in June pledged
            $499m over five years for infrastructure. Compared with what other Arab
            countries receive, these are sizeable sums: annual aid from rich countries
            to Tunisia amounted to almost 3% of GDP last year, against less than 1%
            for Egypt or Morocco.


            Compared with the size of Tunisia’s problems, though, these amounts are
            puny. The country’s debt-to- GDP ratio has more than doubled over the
            past decade, to an estimated 95%. The cost of servicing those loans equals
            7% of GDP . There has been some talk in Washington of using American aid
            as leverage over Mr Saied. But it is probably too small to sway him—particularly
            if Gulf states can match anything withheld by the West.


            The inscrutable Mr Saied, a political outsider elected as a protest against
            Tunisia’s incapable parties, has offered few hints of where he will take
            the country. He will have to juggle the competing demands of civil-society
            activists and politicians wary of his plans; a weak economy that cannot
            cope with instability; and foreign powers with very different visions
            of Tunisia’s future. The vaccine drive bought him a moment of goodwill.
            It may not last. '

        title: Zambia heads towards a pivotal election
        text: 'F OR EDGAR LUNGU , Zambia’s president, elections on August 12th would
            seem to come at an inauspicious time. Over the six years since he took
            office in 2015, the economy has on average grown at a slower rate than
            the population. Last year Africa’s second-largest copper producer had
            its first recession since 1998. Inflation is at its highest level in 19
            years. In July food prices were almost a third higher than a year before.
            In a poll published in May by Afrobarometer, a research group, more than
            three-quarters of Zambians said economic conditions were bad and that
            the country was heading in the wrong direction.

            Yet it is uncertain whether time is up for Mr Lungu (pictured). “The economy
            will determine how people will vote, but it may not determine the result,”
            says Laura Miti, the head of the Alliance for Community Action, an NGO
            based in the capital, Lusaka. Since 2000 roughly three-quarters of incumbent
            African presidents have won re-election, by hook or by crook. Many use
            the power of the state to buy off or bully voters. And that is what Mr
            Lungu’s party, the Patriotic Front ( PF ), seems to be doing, to the detriment
            of a country that was once a trailblazer for African democracy.


            Consider some of the financial ploys used by the PF . Last year it increased
            tenfold the budget for subsidised seeds and fertiliser to woo farmers
            and help business allies of the party. In May of this year it rushed through
            yet more subsidies ahead of the election. In July the government said
            it would “restructure” the personal debts owed by civil servants and transfer
            the liabilities to a state-owned creditor.


            Incumbent parties everywhere court voters with conveniently timed bungs.
            But few have bailed out their bureaucrats while also claiming that they
            have no money to pay their own creditors. In November the government defaulted
            on a dollar bond, making Zambia the first African country to do so during
            the pandemic. Not that covid-19 has much to do with the mess. Government
            debt as a share of GDP has risen from 34% to 110% under Mr Lungu. Though
            there are some Chinese-built roads to show for the splurge, much of the
            money has been wasted.


            Fear and repression


            Inducements are coupled with intimidation. The police use covid-19 regulations
            as a pretext for limiting opposition candidates’ travel and rallies. The
            ostensibly independent electoral commission has repeatedly favoured the
            PF in its decisions. Last year the government ditched the electoral roll
            and gave voters just 38 days to sign up anew. Civil-society groups say
            this was far easier in PF strongholds. Ruling-party “cadres” terrorise
            its opponents, too. Last month Amnesty International published a report
            about the “fear and repression” of the PF regime, which the rights group
            says uses illegal and at times lethal force to break up protests. In June
            a convoy belonging to the main opposition candidate, Hakainde Hichilema,
            was shot at by police. On July 16th a group of Catholic bishops warned
            that “acts of violence are intended to intimidate the citizenry to belong
            to a party or to choose leaders out of fear”. In a worrying development,
            on August 1st Mr Lungu said he would mobilise the army ahead of the vote.


            Zambia, one of the first African countries to embrace multi-party democracy
            in the 1990s, has become a place where criticism of the government is
            punished. The state forced the closure of an independent newspaper in
            2016 and a TV station in 2020. PF loyalists storm critical local radio
            stations. In March 2020 the police arrested a 15-year-old boy for allegedly
            libelling Mr Lungu on Facebook. (He was later released.) There are fears
            of an internet blackout when election results are reported. State media,
            meanwhile, favour the PF .


            Below the belt


            Will the chicanery work? Zambian election results reflect two patterns.
            The first is the ability of parties to mobilise their core support, often
            ethnically based, in rural areas. The second is winning in more competitive
            urban areas such as Lusaka and the Copperbelt. Support for the PF appears
            to be waning in these parts: it lost a by-election in the Copperbelt in
            2019 and, despite restrictions, there have been large gatherings for the
            opposition in the capital.


            Mr Hichilema, whom authorities have jailed 15 times during his political
            career, is making his sixth run for president. This is probably his best
            and last chance. In the past voters have been wary of his minority Tonga
            ethnicity and liberal policies. But ahead of this election, with the help
            of social media, he has presented himself as a unifying reformist. The
            result is hard to call, but an analysis of the Afrobarometer data by academics
            at the University of Cape Town suggests that his United Party for National
            Development ( UPND ) would narrowly win more than 50% of the vote—and
            avoid a run-off—in a fair fight.


            UPND insiders fear they will not face a fair fight, and that the PF will
            fiddle voter tallies and rely on a Constitutional Court packed with allies
            of Mr Lungu to stay in power. A proposal to subject all local election
            monitors to covid-19 testing seems designed to reduce accountability.
            Observers from the EU and other bodies are present, but spread thinly.'

        title: Refugees in east Africa go hungry as funds dry up
        text: 'A T A FOOD distribution centre in Bidibidi, a refugee settlement in
            Uganda, a handwritten cardboard sign tells refugees their maize ration:
            15kg for two months. That works out to 250 grams a day, to go with 60
            grams of beans, a splash of oil and half a teaspoon of salt. A day after
            receiving hers, Ito Juani has already used some of it to repay a loan
            of cassava that got her through a lean spell. “The world has given up
            on us,” she says.

            Who can deny it? In the past year the World Food Programme ( WFP ) has
            slashed rations for more than 3m refugees in seven countries across eastern
            Africa—by 40% in the case of Uganda. In some settlements, where it gives
            out cash instead of food, refugees must make do with 19,000 shillings
            ($5.36) a month. In South Sudan, where rations have fallen by half, the
            WFP is taking from the hungry to feed the starving, writes its executive
            director, David Beasley. Officials say they have only half the money they
            need to feed east African refugees for the rest of the year. Donor fatigue
            had set in before covid-19, but tight pandemic budgets have made things
            worse.


            Most of the 238,000 people who live in Bidibidi fled from South Sudan
            in 2016, walking for days to escape ethnic killings and war. The settlement
            briefly became the largest refugee camp in the world. Today it feels like
            an endless village, clusters of thatched houses sprawling over the horizon.
            It has shops, video halls and small businesses. Uganda’s government, which
            is unusually welcoming, has given the refugees land to till and the right
            to work. But the sheer number of arrivals strains resources. The small,
            stony plots are the scrawniest of vegetable patches.


            Handouts provide staple food and lubricate the settlement’s complex economy.
            A miller will grind maize into flour for a cut of a few handfuls. A few
            more can be bartered for firewood from locals from nearby villages. Some
            are sold to maize dealers to buy goods like soap, sugar and fish. But
            such trade has slowed since rations were cut, says a dealer, clutching
            an empty sack.


            The rhythm of life is set not by the seasons but by “the cycle”, as aid
            workers call the routines of food distribution. The meagre rations rarely
            last until the cycle ends. “When food is distributed, the church is vibrant,”
            says Felix Taban, a pastor. “But when it runs out, people stop coming.”
            In the last weeks of each cycle children “don’t have energy” and drop
            out of school, says Anna Uba Joseph, a teacher. Meanwhile, more patients
            show up at hospital with gastric problems and stress, says a health worker
            there.


            Ms Juani’s own ration ran out 20 days before the cycle ended, which was
            why she had to borrow. For those hungry weeks she stopped taking the antiretroviral
            drugs that treat her AIDS , because she felt ill after swallowing them
            on an empty stomach. Others resort to casual labour. Jane Mandera worked
            on a local farm with her two sons, aged ten and seven, digging under the
            equatorial sun for a meal and 4,000 shillings a day. In the evening she
            boiled up vegetables she had grown herself.


            A WFP survey in March found that 42% of people in Ugandan refugee settlements
            had inadequate diets. Three-quarters of households skipped meals; three-fifths
            borrowed to eat. Stephan Deutscher of the WFP in Uganda says more are
            resorting to emergency measures such as selling assets or pulling children
            from school.


            Aid workers praise Uganda’s openness to refugees, but the model falters
            without the funds to support it. Some hungry refugees now risk returning
            to their abandoned farms in South Sudan. A former policeman says he can
            no longer provide for his family, so he is going back home to join the
            rebels. When will he set off? “As soon as possible,” he says.'

        text: 'T HE PROTEST outside Mohammad Fahmi’s well-guarded house last month
            was a microcosm of Lebanon’s seemingly bottomless collapse. In the crowd
            were relatives of the more than 200 people killed in the catastrophic
            explosion at Beirut’s port on August 4th 2020. They were furious that
            Mr Fahmi, the interior minister, was stonewalling the investigation into
            the blast by refusing to lift immunity for a general.

            It should not have been his decision to make. Mr Fahmi serves under a
            prime minister, Hassan Diab, who resigned last year. But Mr Diab and his
            cabinet lurch along in a caretaker role because Lebanon’s shambolic politicians
            cannot agree on a new government. When the crowds grew rowdy, they were
            pushed back by police whose wages, paid in the debased local currency,
            have shrivelled to less than $100 a month. They are agents of a bankrupt
            state—albeit one that can still afford tear gas.


            Wandering through the capital in the hours and days after the explosion,
            it was hard to imagine things could get any worse. Caused by a cache of
            ammonium nitrate—some 2,750 tonnes of the stuff had been impounded in
            2013 and stored improperly—the blast left much of the city centre in ruins.
            Shattered glass rained down from buildings. Residents were thrown against
            the walls of their apartments by an explosion large enough to be felt
            in Cyprus, 240km (150 miles) away.


            Yet a year later things are indeed worse, almost immeasurably so. The
            blast was not a nadir, just another twist on Lebanon’s long downward spiral.
            There has been no accountability for the disaster. Nor is there a government
            empowered to tackle an economic crisis that, according to the World Bank,
            may rank as the third worst anywhere in the world since the 1850s.


            Soon after the explosion, Lebanon’s cabinet set up a committee to investigate
            what happened. It promised results within five days. It has had that,
            and 360 more, yet today even the basic facts remain a mystery. The most
            commonly cited death toll of 218 may be too low because it fails to count
            refugees and migrants. America’s FBI , invited to help with the probe
            a year ago, believes that only about a fifth of the 2,750 tonnes of ammonium
            nitrate exploded. What happened to the rest—whether it was sold, moved
            elsewhere or somehow disposed of—is unclear.


            The judge overseeing the probe, Tarek Bitar, has run into a wall of opposition.
            He has pushed to interrogate several ex-ministers and Abbas Ibrahim, the
            head of Lebanon’s main intelligence agency. But lawmakers have refused
            to allow them to be questioned. Blame for the blast is widely shared:
            many senior officials knew the ammonium nitrate was there, a time-bomb
            waiting to go off, and did nothing about it. They have closed ranks. (Mr
            Bitar’s predecessor was dismissed earlier this year after he charged four
            officials with negligence.)


            Mr Diab resigned days after the explosion. But two men tapped to form
            a new government—Mustapha Adib, a little-known diplomat, and Saad Hariri,
            a former prime minister—failed to do so. On July 26th lawmakers asked
            another ex-prime minister, Najib Mikati, to try his hand.


            He may not be successful either. The post-civil-war political system in
            Lebanon doles out portfolios based on religious sect, and efforts to form
            a cabinet have run into internecine disputes. The two main Shia parties,
            Hizbullah and Amal, both want to control the finance ministry. The president,
            Michel Aoun, wants to preserve his power base so that he can install his
            son-in-law, Gebran Bassil, as his successor next year. Mr Hariri wanted
            a government that would satisfy his backers in the Gulf. Everyone has
            an eye on parliamentary elections scheduled for May.

            Lebanon cannot afford such a delay. It tipped into economic crisis in
            2019, the result of a years-long Ponzi scheme overseen by the central
            bank, which borrowed billions from an outsized banking industry to sustain
            a currency peg. The scheme unravelled when banks no longer took in enough
            fresh deposits to keep it going. Mr Diab estimated there was an $83bn
            hole in their balance-sheets last year.


            The country defaulted in 2020, and Mr Diab presented a plan for repairing
            the banking industry. But it was doomed by opposition from the banks and
            their political allies. Talks with the IMF about a rescue package have
            stalled, as have negotiations with creditors. Western countries are unwilling
            to help without serious reforms, to include an audit of the central bank,
            whose governor, Riad Salamé, is under investigation in France and Switzerland
            for alleged money-laundering. The bank has burned through most, if not
            all, of its usable foreign reserves, which stood at $38bn before the crisis.
            In June it lowered the share of deposits that private banks must keep
            with it from 15% to 14%, in effect freeing up a bit of cash to spend on
            imports.


            Once reliably pegged at 1,500 to the dollar, the Lebanese pound traded
            as low as 23,000 on the black market in July (see chart). It later rebounded
            to nearly 15,000—still a 90% depreciation. Inflation was 101% in June,
            and 222% for food. Half the country now lives below the poverty line.
            A family of five needs 3.5m pounds, five times the minimum wage, just
            to buy food each month, estimate researchers at the American University
            of Beirut. Some shops and restaurants have stopped listing prices because
            they change so often. Medicine remains subsidised, but is often hard to
            find. Visiting expats stuff suitcases with drugs that are no longer available,
            including basic items such as paracetamol.


            Creaky power plants are short on fuel and provide only a few hours of
            electricity each day. Residents have always relied on private generators
            to fill the gaps, but their operators are also struggling to find fuel
            and buy spare parts to fix machines that were never meant to run round
            the clock. Nightfall brings an eerie darkness to Beirut. Dawn brings a
            new ritual: drivers trudge down to their cars and queue up for petrol,
            a litre of which, at subsidised prices, costs as little as 20 cents. That
            has fuelled a brisk black market. Smugglers buy the stuff in Lebanon and
            sell it in Syria, which is struggling with its own fuel crisis.


            A glance at newspaper headlines over the past few weeks offers a bleak
            portrait of collapse. A young girl died from a scorpion sting that could
            not be treated for lack of antivenom in depleted hospitals and pharmacies.
            A teenage boy died trying to battle wildfires that the bankrupt state
            is struggling to control. A man was killed in a traffic accident while
            queuing for fuel on a main road south of Beirut.


            The country feels exhausted. Beirutis wander the streets glassy-eyed;
            no one is sleeping well, without even a fan to cut the heat and humidity.
            Everyone seems to have caught a stomach bug this summer from food spoiled
            by power cuts. A small, well-heeled elite is still hosting lavish weddings
            and expensive lunches by the sea, but for most Lebanese the days are a
            brew of rage and despair. Once again, it is hard to imagine things could
            get any worse.


            Once again, they probably will. The worsening shortage of hard currency
            will make it more difficult to subsidise goods. Fuel subsidies have kept
            inflation from being even higher. They were already reduced in June; when
            they are curtailed further, prices will soar higher still. The army is
            struggling to keep up morale. It has asked for foreign aid to feed soldiers
            and offers tourists joyrides in military helicopters for $150 a pop to
            drum up foreign currency. There will be longer blackouts and deeper shortages
            as the state struggles to finance basic imports. The World Bank calls
            this a “deliberate depression”, a man-made crisis—and the men who made
            it are still in power, with no plan to fix it.

        title: Ebrahim Raisi takes office, as Iran and the West face off
        text: 'O N THE FIRST day of his two-part inauguration on August 3rd, Ebrahim
            Raisi regretted that he could not kiss the hand of his mentor, Ayatollah
            Ali Khamenei, owing to covid-19 restrictions. But there was no doubting
            the bond between Mr Raisi, Iran’s new president, and Mr Khamenei, its
            supreme leader. Both men are hardline clerics who view the world, and
            the West in particular, with suspicion. “Trusting the West does not yield
            results,” said Mr Khamenei in the run-up to the ceremony.

            Some in Iran may be pushing for confrontation. On July 29th, just days
            before the inauguration, a drone laden with explosives was flown into
            the MV Mercer Street, an oil tanker off the coast of Oman managed by an
            Israeli-owned firm. Two crew members, a Briton and a Romanian, were killed.
            America, Britain, Israel and Romania blamed Iran, which denied involvement.
            Saeed Khatibzadeh, an Iranian foreign-ministry spokesman, accused Israel
            of creating “instability, terror and violence” and warned that “whoever
            sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind”.


            Then, on August 3rd, came another incident in nearby waters (see map).
            Gunmen boarded a bitumen tanker, the MV Asphalt Princess, and sailed it
            towards Iran before disembarking some 15 hours later, after the crew reportedly
            sabotaged the engines. The crew said the assailants were Iranians, according
            to recordings of communications between the ship and the Emirati coastguard
            heard by Argus Media, an energy-information firm. Iran denied involvement.
            The Asphalt Princess is owned by a firm in Dubai that had another vessel
            hijacked two years ago by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC
            ), Iran’s most powerful military force.


            Iran and its proxies have exchanged attacks with America, Saudi Arabia
            and the United Arab Emirates in recent years. A shadow war between Iran
            and Israel has also been escalating. Several vessels have been attacked,
            with each side blaming the other. Israel has struck Iranian positions
            in Syria and is accused of attacking people and facilities in Iran, sometimes
            with cyber-weapons. An attack earlier this year on Iran’s main uranium-enrichment
            complex, in Natanz, using planted explosives, did significant damage.


            If the IRGC is behind the attacks on shipping, it will come as no surprise.
            Its workings are murky, but it often seems to pursue a policy at odds
            with that of the weak elected government. Or at least, it did when Hassan
            Rouhani, a pragmatist who reached out to the West, was still president
            (he handed over to Mr Raisi after the maximum two consecutive terms).
            With hardliners now in control of the entire government, there should
            be less tension. “Under the new administration, Iran will be much more
            assertive,” says Mohammad Marandi, an academic who is close to the IRGC
            .


            All of this complicates efforts to revive the nuclear deal signed in 2015
            by Iran and six world powers. That agreement, called the Joint Comprehensive
            Plan of Action ( JCPOA ), had Iran curb its nuclear programme and agree
            to rigorous inspections in return for the lifting of some international
            sanctions. But in 2018, during the presidency of Donald Trump, America
            abandoned the deal. In response, Iran began breaking parts of it.


            President Joe Biden has promised to return to the deal if Iran comes back
            into compliance. In an address on August 3rd Mr Raisi said his government
            would take steps to lift the “tyrannical” sanctions imposed by America.
            But a sixth round of indirect negotiations to revive the JCPOA ended in
            June. There is no date set for the resumption of talks. Iran, meanwhile,
            has continued to expand its nuclear activity. It is enriching uranium
            beyond the levels required for civilian use and it has sharply curbed
            co-operation with inspectors.


            Britain will raise the strike on the Mercer Street at the UN . “The UK
            is working with our international partners on a concerted response to
            this unacceptable attack,” said Dominic Raab, its foreign secretary. “Ultimately,
            we have got to restore deterrence,” said General Sir Nick Carter, its
            most senior military officer.


            Still, America and Britain may want to limit any response in order to
            keep the JCPOA talks alive. Israel’s leaders, never fans of the nuclear
            deal, may prefer more forceful action. “This time the price is going up,”
            says Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence.

        title: Israel is loth to regulate its spyware exports
        text: 'W HEN INTERNATIONAL news organisations revealed that at least ten governments
            had used Pegasus, a powerful software tool created by Israel’s NSO Group,
            to hack into the smartphones of thousands of people around the world,
            including politicians, human-rights activists and journalists, the Israeli
            government shrugged. A humdrum official statement insisted that all Israeli
            cyber-exports were regulated by the government in “adherence to international
            arrangements”. Export licences were granted “exclusively to governmental
            entities, for lawful use, and only for the purpose of preventing and investigating
            crime and counter-terrorism”.

            Israeli defence exporters privately expressed ridicule. “Arms companies
            can’t keep track of every rifle and bullet they sell to legitimate customers,”
            said one. “Why should we have higher expectations when it comes to software?...Israeli
            spying is a sexy subject and these reports are the price for doing business.”


            In any case, the Pegasus customer list correlates neatly with many of
            the governments courted by Israel’s former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu,
            who lost his job in June. These include like-minded populists such as
            the rulers of Brazil, Hungary and India, along with Sunni Arab regimes
            with whom Israel recently established diplomatic relations: Bahrain, Morocco
            and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, a fellow enemy of Iran, is
            listed, too. “Deals on cyber-surveillance are the kind of sweetener you
            can throw into a diplomatic package with a foreign leader,” says a former
            NSO consultant.


            Israel’s new government, too, has close ties to the cyber-industry. The
            prime minister, Naftali Bennett, made a fortune as a founder of an online-banking
            security company and is a cyber-defence aficionado. His interior minister
            and right-hand woman, Ayeled Shaked, is a former tech executive with friends
            at NSO ; she supported awarding the firm government contracts. The new
            defence minister, Benny Gantz, chaired a company that specialised in data-mining
            for policing and counter-terror purposes. The head of that (now defunct)
            company, Ram Ben Barak, a former Mossad bigwig, currently chairs the foreign-affairs
            and defence committee, which monitors cyber-exports. A hearing on the
            NSO affair is scheduled, but only in a secretive subcommittee behind closed
            doors.


            Israel’s Defence Export Control Law of 2007 requires companies to undergo
            a rigorous licensing process. It was passed after America, Israel’s chief
            patron, complained about Israel selling arms to China. But defence officials
            and human-rights campaigners admit that once a licence has been obtained,
            the Israeli government prefers not to know how the tools are used.


            Some firms have set up in-house ethics committees, fearing that otherwise
            they might become tainted, making it harder to do business in the West.
            “The more progressive-minded workforce coming to the fore in America’s
            tech giants could treat Israel as a pariah, object to having research
            centres in Israel and collaborating with Israeli companies,” says a veteran
            dealmaker. Stung by the Pegasus revelations, investors in Novalpina Capital,
            a private-equity firm that owns NSO , are thinking of liquidating the
            fund. But Israel’s rulers, old and new, have fewer qualms.


            Correction (August 6th 2021): This article originally stated that none
            of Israel’s ministers publicly commented on the reports about NSO Group.
            In fact, the diaspora affairs minister did comment, saying firms such
            as NSO Group are causing direct harm to Israel’s diplomatic interests.
            Sorry.'

        title: A tangy Nigerian cooking ingredient is cheering the diaspora
        text: 'T HE FERMENTED African locust bean, known in Yoruba as iru, has an
            unmistakable cheesy tang that hits you before you see it. “Iru isn’t just
            a flavour on the tongue,” says Ozoz Sokoh, a food blogger. After an elaborate
            process of fermentation, the smell is essential to its flavour. Iru is
            further enriched once tossed in smoky, bleached palm oil.

            Long before Nestlé came to Nigeria with its Maggi bouillon cubes, iru
            was flavouring soups, stews and rice dishes. After independence the cube,
            with its monosodium glutamate seasoning, became more popular than iru,
            particularly in cities. But iru is making a worldwide comeback, thanks
            to a dish called ayamase which is packed with it.


            A decade ago you would have been hard-pressed to find ayamase on a party
            menu. Instead you might have found ofada, a dish named after a town in
            south-western Nigeria close to Lagos, the commercial capital. It consists
            of unpolished rice and a spicy fried red-pepper beef stew. But now ayamase,
            the green-pepper rival of ofada, is wherever you find Nigerians, at home
            or abroad.


            Bilikisu Raji, who lives in Ibadan, another big city in the south-west,
            was taught to ferment iru by her mother-in-law. The iru enterprise is
            run by women because, she jokes in Yoruba, the men aren’t up to it. She
            buys the yellow-tinged seeds in the market and boils them for 12 hours
            in a cauldron. She removes the chaff to reveal black-brown beans, peels
            them with the balls of her feet, washes them through a sieve, then boils
            them again. Eventually she dry-roasts them and covers them with a raffia
            tray to let them ferment overnight. Finally she rubs the iru in salt,
            then rolls it up in dry leaves, ready to sell. A small wrap weighing 20
            grams goes for only 50 naira (an American dime). She survives on the patronage
            of foreign customers who buy as much as $25-worth at a time to use in
            ayamase abroad.


            Nowadays you can find iru on shelves across the world. Ms Sokoh, who has
            lived in the Netherlands and Canada, has seen it in shops everywhere.
            “You find frozen iru, fresh iru, powdered iru, dried iru on the shelves
            in ways you couldn’t ten years ago,” she says. Suffering from high blood
            pressure, she steers clear of stock cubes in favour of iru. “There’s definitely
            a saltiness without being sodium-heavy,” she says.


            To non-West Africans, iru is likely to remain a niche ingredient “like
            fish sauce”, sighs Tunde Wey, a popular Nigerian chef based in New Orleans.
            He has collaborated with an American company to sell iru in sleek jars,
            hoping to boost small farmers back home while getting fellow cooks abroad
            to appreciate its versatility. Whether or not Western foodies catch on

        title: In Ethiopia’s civil war, Tigrayan forces take the offensive
        text: 'T HE STREETS of Dessie, in Ethiopia’s Amhara region, are loud and bustling.
            So are its restaurants and bars. But as Ethiopia’s civil war edges closer,
            the mood is darkening. In the past week military-training camps have sprung
            up. Outside a hospital a tent has been erected; wounded soldiers lie on
            stretchers. Through mountain fog come the screams of ambulance sirens.
            Such is the tension gripping the place that when your correspondent visited,
            he was arrested almost immediately and held for several hours.

            The jitters are because rebels from Tigray are advancing fast and meeting
            weak resistance. As The Economist went to press, the fighting was drawing
            near to Weldiya, a strategically important town about 80km north of Dessie.
            To the west they have penetrated to within perhaps 80km of Gondar, Ethiopia’s
            historic capital (see map).


            A few weeks ago, when the insurgents captured most of the Tigray region,
            including Mekelle, the capital, there may have been a chance for a negotiated
            end to Ethiopia’s civil war and accompanying humanitarian crisis. Instead,
            the war may be entering its most dangerous phase yet.


            On June 28th Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, announced a unilateral
            ceasefire and withdrew his troops from Tigray. Yet instead of using the
            opportunity to open talks with the rebels led by the Tigrayan People’s
            Liberation Front ( TPLF ), the region’s ruling party, Abiy tightened a
            blockade. Ignoring calls to join the ceasefire the TPLF has sent its forces
            well beyond Tigray’s borders. As well as into Amhara, they have marched
            east into the Afar region in what seems like a bid to control the road
            and rail link to Djibouti, through which about 95% of landlocked Ethiopia’s
            trade flows. The TPLF may even be mulling a march on Addis Ababa, the
            federal capital, to remove Abiy by force. Abiy has responded with a call
            for total war, invoking the battle of Adwa, when Ethiopians from all corners
            defeated Italian invaders in 1896. The president of Amhara has ordered
            all armed residents to mobilise in a “campaign for survival”, while the
            president of Afar has called on his people to protect their land “whether
            by guns, sticks or stones”. Other regions have also sent in paramilitary
            forces. The tactics on both sides are risky. The government’s mobilisation
            of ethnic militias is a recipe for bloodletting: most of their members
            are poorly trained and have been whipped up by allegations of Tigrayan
            atrocities. “Everyone is ready with anything they have, from machetes
            to Kalashnikovs,” says Teqil Nigusse, a merchant in Weldiya. In Addis
            Ababa and elsewhere, ordinary Tigrayans are being treated as fifth-columnists.
            Hundreds have been arrested and scores of Tigrayan-owned businesses, including
            hotels and bars, have been closed, in some cases simply for playing Tigrayan
            music. For now, though, the Tigrayan forces have the upper hand. As the
            Ethiopian army has retreated, they have captured its heavy artillery.
            And they have turned their once-disorganised ranks into an effective fighting
            force, motivated by the murders and rapes committed by Ethiopian and Eritrean
            soldiers. The insurgents’ counterparts in Amhara, by contrast, lack training
            and have been hastily assembled. The Tigrayans “have the military advantage
            now”, frets a young policeman in Dessie.


            Even so, the Tigrayans’ gamble is also risky. Rather than focus on reclaiming
            disputed territory occupied by Amhara forces in the west, they are attacking
            on many fronts—and risk overstretching themselves. Tigrayans make up only
            about 7% of Ethiopia’s population. Amharas alone outnumber them four to
            one.


            Securing the road to Djibouti, moreover, is no easy feat. The scorching
            deserts of Afar are harsh terrain and, beyond their own borders, Tigrayan
            forces cannot rely on widespread local support. The fighting in Afar has
            already forced tens of thousands of civilians from their homes. The resistance
            may be stiffening. Federal troops backed by Afar paramilitary forces seem
            to have halted the Tigrayan advance in the east. “Invading Afar was a
            historic mistake,” argues Dawud Mohammed Ali, a local academic.


            The second risk is political. When the TPLF arrived in Addis Ababa in
            1991 as a band of guerrillas who had toppled Ethiopia’s then military
            dictatorship, it could count on support from many of Ethiopia’s more than
            80 ethnic groups. But after almost three decades in charge of the government
            in Addis Ababa, it has few friends left. Many would regard any move towards
            the capital as a brazen attempt to put itself back on the throne.'

        title: Why Jordan leads the way in Arabic-language training
        text: 'T HE COUNTER of Fahad Subeihi’s falafel stand is stacked with piles
            of sliced tomatoes, onions and pickled turnips dyed pink. “The students
            love it,” he says. Mr Subeihi’s stand is located in the Jabal Amman neighbourhood
            of Jordan’s capital, Amman, amid a bevy of Arabic-language schools. Mr
            Subeihi estimates that, before the pandemic, half of his customers were
            foreigners, mostly Western students.

            Jordan has cornered the market in Arabic-language training in the region.
            Unlike many of its neighbours, it is relatively stable and at peace. Its
            nickname, the “Hashemite Kingdom of Boredom”, may turn off thrill-seekers.
            But it attracts Western universities and grant programmes, which have
            largely stopped sending students to more volatile countries.


            “Amman has become our largest centre,” says Pauline Koetschet of the French
            Institute of the Near East ( IFPO ), which teaches mainly European students.
            IFPO used to have centres in Aleppo and Damascus, but closed them because
            of Syria’s civil war. It still has a centre in Beirut, Lebanon’s unruly
            capital, but schools are increasingly worried about sending students there.
            “We have universities that tend to prefer Amman for security,” she says.


            Oman and Morocco also offer stability, but Jordan has other advantages.
            Unlike Oman, at the tip of the Arabian peninsula, Jordan is in the heart
            of the Arab world. And although Morocco is still a popular destination,
            its dialect, called darija, is difficult to understand. Jordan’s, on the
            other hand, is close to the Modern Standard Arabic taught in most Western
            classrooms.


            “I feel like Amman has a monopoly on Arabic-language students from America,”
            says Patrick, who studied Arabic on a grant from Boren, a language programme
            funded by America’s Defence Department. In normal times Jordan is Boren’s
            second-most popular destination for grant recipients after Taiwan. (Arabic
            and Mandarin are languages the programme deems crucial to national security.)
            Students on Boren grants cannot train in countries for which the State
            Department has issued high-level travel advisories, which have become
            common during the pandemic. Even before, though, the rule meant nearly
            all of Jordan’s neighbours were out of luck.


            The pandemic has cut into the number of Arabic-language students travelling
            to the region, so Jordan has been hit particularly hard. Katy Whiting
            of the Sijal Institute, an Arabic-language school in Jabal Amman, says
            that normally over 200 students would be enrolled at Sijal during the
            summer. As it is, 30 are attending classes in person and another 30 are
            studying online.


            The absence of students has hurt neighbourhoods like Jabal Amman, which
            is eerily quiet. Muhammad Zuher says his restaurant, Kmajeh, near the
            popular Rainbow Street, used to draw a steady crowd of Western students.
            Now it is largely empty. Still, he is confident the students will return.
            “They want security, safety and to practise Arabic with locals,” he says.
            “Welcome to Jordan.” '

        title: Tunisia’s democracy totters as the president suspends parliament
        text: 'S OME CHEERED it as a necessary intervention into a broken political
            system. Others called it a “coup”, the possible end of Tunisian democracy.
            No one is playing down the significance of President Kais Saied’s decision
            to enact Article 80 of the constitution, under which he suspended parliament
            for 30 days and dismissed the prime minister, Hichem Mechichi.

            The president’s decision, delivered late on July 25th in his customarily
            awkward style, came after a day of widespread protests. Tens of thousands
            of Tunisians, defying a covid-19 lockdown, called for the downfall of
            the government. Some attacked the offices of Ennahda, the biggest party
            in parliament. After Mr Saied’s announcement many of the protesters again
            took to the streets—to celebrate (pictured).


            Tunisia is the one true democracy to emerge from the Arab spring protests
            of 2010-11 that toppled dictators in a handful of countries. But it has
            struggled in the decade since. Ten governments in ten years have failed
            to stem corruption or revitalise the economy, which shrunk by 8.6% last
            year. Covid-19 has added to the strain. The government declared victory
            over the virus a year ago. Now Tunisia is suffering a new spike in cases.
            The health service has collapsed. Oxygen supplies are at a premium. About
            200 people (out of a population of 12m) are dying each day from the disease
            (see chart).


            Earlier this month the government opened dozens of centres offering covid-19
            vaccines. Large crowds showed up expecting to be jabbed, only to find
            chaos, confusion and rumours of vaccine shortages. The dismissal of the
            health minister did little to appease an angry public—nor did the prime
            minister’s claim of ignorance over the operation. In a harbinger of things
            to come, Mr Saied stepped in, asking the army to assume management of
            the country’s pandemic response. The president’s power grab was condemned
            by the largest parties in parliament. But Mr Saied seems unswayed. He
            has since fired the defence minister and acting justice minister, while
            lengthening an existing curfew and banning public gatherings of more than
            three people. The police raided the office of Al Jazeera, a media outlet
            seen as sympathetic to Ennahda. Mr Saied was elected two years ago as
            a protest against the political class. A former constitutional-law professor
            with no previous political experience, he won with 73% of the vote, drawing
            support from young Tunisians and others who viewed him as incorruptible.
            The same election produced a fractious parliament, with no party or coalition
            claiming a majority. Mr Saied has thus attempted to play a larger role
            in domestic policy, previously the preserve of the prime minister and
            government. Since January the president has refused to swear in 11 new
            ministers.


            It is no secret that Mr Saied, who helped to write Tunisia’s constitution
            (but later criticised it), wants to upend the political system. He would
            like the president to have more power and to do away with political parties
            and some elections. Instead, he suggests that Tunisians should elect local
            delegates, based on their merit, not their ideology. These delegates would
            appoint regional representatives, who would then appoint members of a
            national assembly. According to the constitution, two-thirds of parliament
            would need to approve any revision of the charter.


            What Mr Saied has planned for the near term is unclear. He has claimed
            the power to extend the 30-day suspension of parliament “until the situation
            settles down”. For now he says he will assume executive authority with
            the help of a new prime minister, whom he will appoint. Mr Mechichi released
            a statement saying he would not be a "disruptive element" and would hand
            over power to whomever Mr Saied selected.


            Ennahda, a party with roots in the Muslim Brotherhood (a regional Islamist
            movement) which now styles itself “Muslim democratic”, has also tried
            to calm things down. It has been a political force ever since the revolution,
            and many Tunisians blame it for the country’s woes. But its leader, Rachid
            Ghannouchi, who is also speaker of parliament, helped get Tunisia through
            its last big political crisis, in 2013-14, by joining a national dialogue.
            His party has suggested holding another one and withdrew calls for protest.


            America and European democracies have expressed concern over Mr Saied’s
            move. But Tunisians say they have not done enough to support their country
            over the past decade. The president faces an immediate challenge in managing
            Tunisia’s relationship with the IMF . The government had been negotiating
            a much-needed loan from the fund, which may now think twice about making
            any commitment.


            Tunisia is also caught up in a regional rivalry that pits countries such
            as Turkey and Qatar, which supported the Arab spring and the Islamist
            groups that benefited, against those such as Saudi Arabia and the United
            Arab Emirates, which opposed the uprisings. Saudi and Emirati commentators
            were quick to hail Mr Saied’s actions as a blow to political Islam.


            In meetings with civil-society groups Mr Saied has promised to protect
            Tunisian democracy. Yet he seems likely to try to reshape it in a way
            that gives him more power. Tunisia will not emerge from the crisis looking
            like Saudi Arabia. But it will probably be a little less democratic. '

        text: 'T O TRAVEL AROUND Durban last week was to witness scenes of wholesale
            devastation. Shopping centres were ransacked, with nothing left but decapitated
            mannequins lying amid broken glass. Torched factories smouldered, the
            smell of burnt materials wafting on the breeze from the Indian Ocean.
            Not that one could escape into the water. A noxious spill, thought to
            be from a scorched chemical warehouse, had closed the beach.

            Elsewhere a humanitarian crisis was spreading. Queues for food snaked
            for ever. The main motorway into the city was closed after dozens of lorries
            were set alight. The country’s largest factory making anti-retroviral
            drugs was up in smoke. Vital supplies of bread, pills and nappies had
            to be flown in from Johannesburg. The city that hosts one of Africa’s
            busiest ports looked like the site of a natural disaster.


            As in the case of America’s Hurricane Katrina, the carnage revealed much
            about the country in which it occurred—except that in South Africa the
            disaster was entirely man-made. In particular, the worst violence since
            the end of apartheid puts a spotlight on the party of Nelson Mandela,
            the African National Congress ( ANC ). Its failure to build a properly
            functioning state and to deliver economic growth created the potential
            for chaos. Its own factional battles set the timing. The effects of the
            destruction will be felt for years in Africa’s most industrialised country.


            The proximate cause of the unrest is clear. On July 7th Jacob Zuma began
            a 15-month prison sentence for defying an order by the Constitutional
            Court to appear at an inquiry into vast corruption during his presidency
            of 2009-18. Messages calling for an uprising soon spread on social media.
            Thousands of people in townships in the provinces of Gauteng, which contains
            Johannesburg, and KwaZulu-Natal ( KZN ), the birthplace of Mr Zuma and
            home to the cities of Durban and Pietermaritzburg, descended on factories,
            warehouses and malls. They were cheered on by those close to Mr Zuma,
            such as his daughter, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla. Her twin brother, Duduzane
            Zuma, who has political ambitions, said people should steal “carefully”
            and “responsibly”. He later noted that the loss of at least 276 lives
            was “not an ideal situation for them and for any of us”.


            And allies of Mr Zuma did more than cheer. On July 16th President Cyril
            Ramaphosa spoke of an “insurrection” and “nothing less than a deliberate,
            co-ordinated and well-planned attack on our democracy”. Three days later
            the government said it had arrested six of the “instigators”. On July
            20th Mr Ramaphosa mentioned the use of “criminal networks” to organise
            looting. Though this may not have been a coup attempt, it was certainly
            an effort to render the country ungovernable and Mr Ramaphosa unpopular,
            so as to force the release of Mr Zuma and let his friends reassert control
            of the ANC .


            Edendale, a township outside Pietermaritzburg, was among the first to
            explode. “Society is divided,” explains Michael Malinga, who farms chickens
            having recently lost his job with a local NGO . “These are the people
            who are envious of the good life that is being lived over there,” he said,
            pointing towards affluent suburbs. Although Mr Zuma’s incarceration was
            the “trigger”, he says, “looting didn’t take much to trigger.”


            Peering at South Africa’s statistics verges on voyeurism. The unemployment
            rate, 33% in the first quarter of 2021, is the highest on record, perhaps
            the highest in the world. And it excludes those who have given up looking.
            Nearly half of black South Africans cannot find work or have stopped trying.
            Roughly 13m South Africans (22%) were hungry even before covid-19’s third
            wave, according to a survey.


            Lockdowns have pushed people deeper into poverty. Poor workers, nearly
            all of whom are not white, are almost four times as likely to have lost
            jobs since covid-19 than higher-paid ones. The end of welfare grants introduced
            at the start of the virus has led to more hunger. A booze ban announced
            on June 27th has created “alcohol-thirsty people”, says Mr Malinga.


            Desperation explains some of the horror. At a supermarket near Edendale
            five people died in a stampede; in a similar scene in Soweto ten perished.
            Other images shared on social media hint at the inequality behind the
            dash for goods, such as the woman who reportedly ended up with a couch
            worth 68,000 rand ($4,600) that was far too big to fit in her shack. “This
            is as close to a rebellion against inequality as SA has ever come,” argues
            Jonny Steinberg, a South African writer.


            As more people joined in the looting, others began to feel left out. “We’ve
            become a joke, us people who don’t loot. People say ‘you’re stupid’”,
            says Kwasi Molefe, from the Chesterville township near Durban. Some people
            did not want to steal but feared there might be no food left in the shops,
            explains a grandmother.


            Whatever the precise mix of conspiracy and poverty behind the violence,
            it was facilitated by failures of security. Police watched as people piled
            contraband onto pickup trucks. In downtown Pietermaritzburg one ransacked
            supermarket is around the corner from the main police station. Neither
            the criminal-intelligence branch of the police nor the domestic spy agency
            saw the violence coming or forewarned others in government. It took almost
            a week for the deployment of up to 25,000 troops to be authorised, a move
            that ultimately helped quell the chaos.


            As so often, ordinary South Africans filled the gap left by the state.
            At night in the suburbs of Durban and Pietermaritzburg, and in smaller
            KZN towns, pallets, branches and barbed wire were shoved into street entrances
            as barricades. Residents, some armed, took turns to stand guard overnight.
            In most cases these vigils were peaceful. “I’ve never felt safer,” says
            Wimpie De Lange at the barricade between Chesterville and Westville, a
            suburb on the other side of the motorway. “This is South Africa. We come
            together after chaos.” At a roadblock in Pietermaritzburg a group of whites
            and South Africans of Indian descent joked with black students entering
            nearby university halls of residence. In case of trouble the whites had
            golf clubs and the Indians cricket bats. But tensions have risen, at times
            fatally. In Phoenix, an Indian township north of Durban, at least 20 deaths
            have been reported. In a nearby black township residents say that family
            members were racially profiled and shot by Indians. Police and human-rights
            groups are investigating. Even in peaceful areas some are uneasy about
            the roadblocks. Mbali Ntuli, a member of the opposition Democratic Alliance
            ( DA ), who lives in a Durban suburb, says, “I don’t feel super comfortable
            as a black person with people asking me whether I live here.” She notes
            that it reminds her mother of apartheid, when black South Africans needed
            passes to enter white areas. Yet, adds Ms Ntuli, she understands the need
            for communities to protect themselves. “People are realising how exposed
            and unprotected we are.” For many, she says, “this is the final straw.”


            Shades of the bad old days


            It is a long cry from April 1994. Back then the world watched as South
            Africans queued from dawn to vote in the country’s first fully democratic
            election. Today the queues are for food, petrol and medicine. How did
            it come to this?


            For most of the 20th century South Africa was a white-supremacist state.
            The creation of modern South Africa in 1910 established peace between
            Afrikaners (those of mainly Dutch descent) and British settlers at the
            expense of black people. The brutality of apartheid, introduced in 1948,
            built on colonial foundations. Under the National Party whites benefited
            from state largesse while non-whites were violently displaced and exploited.
            By the late 1980s white rule was morally and literally bankrupt. Pressure
            from the anti-apartheid struggle, capital flight and the end of the cold
            war brought about its demise.


            The negotiated transition is seen by many on the left as a stitch-up.
            Blacks may have got the vote, goes the argument, but economic power remained
            with whites. “We missed the boat in 1994. We have no one to blame but
            ourselves,” says Important Mkhize, a leftist ANC figure, referring to
            his party’s apparent failings.


            Such views, like mutterings about how life was better under apartheid,
            are overly cynical. Under Mandela (president from 1994 to 1999) and his
            successor, Thabo Mbeki (1999-2008), life improved for nearly all South
            Africans. Proper houses were built roughly ten times faster than shacks.
            Townships got running water and electricity. A basic welfare state was
            established. “Social grant” recipients rose from 2.5m to 12.4m under Mr
            Mbeki. His government’s sensible macroeconomic policies and a commodities
            boom raised growth to an average of 5% a year for four straight years
            for the first time since the 1960s. Unemployment went from horrific to
            merely awful.


            Yet trouble was brewing. A corrupt arms deal in 1999, for which Mr Zuma
            still faces charges, set the standard for future graft. Black Economic
            Empowerment, a policy that incentivises firms to give equity to black
            investors or business to black-owned suppliers, has created a new generation
            of Randlords with more political acumen than entrepreneurial talent. “Cadre
            deployment”, whereby ANC party members get jobs on the basis of factional
            fealty rather than merit, has degraded the state. These appointees steer
            contracts towards chosen “tenderpreneurs”, who in turn donate to the party.
            By 2007 Kgalema Motlanthe, a party grandee, said: “This rot is across
            the board...Almost every project is conceived because it offers opportunities
            for certain people to make money.”


            The blackouts that still plague the country began under Mr Mbeki, who
            neglected Eskom, the state power utility. His abject handling of the AIDS
            plague cost at least 330,000 lives, according to a Harvard study. It also
            contributed to his loss in a factional battle to Mr Zuma, who took over
            as the ANC ’s president in 2007. That moment was crucial in fragmenting
            the party. What one ANC official called the party’s “rational centre”
            could no longer hold. Anarchy was loosed upon the country.


            At its heart was Mr Zuma. Under him much of the progress was squandered.
            Corruption soared. The lure of jobs in the party led to scores of assassinations,
            most of them in KZN , where Mr Zuma’s fellow Zulus predominate. Agencies
            meant to stop crime ran smear campaigns on political enemies. Government
            came to resemble an organised-crime gang.


            The economy was not helped by the global financial crisis and the end
            of the commodities boom. But “state capture” made things worse by deterring
            investment. Though growth slowed, the government kept on spending, more
            than doubling the share of debt to GDP during Mr Zuma’s reign. Much of
            this was directed to looted state-owned enterprises and wage rises for
            existing public-sector workers. To try to keep finances in check, the
            Treasury increased regressive taxes and ministries slowed the hiring of
            teachers, nurses and police. The result, writes Michael Sachs, a former
            Treasury official, is that “the real value of public services—particularly
            to the poor—has fallen.”


            A year after bruising local-election results in 2016, the party rejected
            Mr Zuma and his preferred successor (an ex-wife). They turned instead
            to Mr Ramaphosa, who promised more jobs and less graft. His approach has
            been to lead from behind, appointing people to key jobs and leaving them
            alone. But he has not gone far enough. The “security cluster”, especially
            police and spies, is ineffectual. His cabinet remains replete with incompetents.
            Mr Ramaphosa’s defenders argue that he has to tread carefully because
            he needs to win internal ANC elections to stay in power. Yet South Africans
            are frustrated that he puts party before country.


            The result of ANC misrule has been the entrenchment of two South Africas.
            In one, a multi-racial, but still disproportionately white, minority lives
            in a privatised bubble: private security, private schools, private health
            care and, increasingly, private (solar or generator) electricity and (borehole)
            water, too. In the other live most black and mixed-race (“coloured”) South
            Africans, with shoddy services, joblessness and hungry stomachs.


            Before the unrest, NGO s working in townships warned of simmering tensions
            taken to boiling point by covid-19. The South African Human Rights Commission
            recently called Alexandra, a Johannesburg township, a “ticking time bomb”.
            The Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice and Dignity Group said on June 30th,
            with devastating prescience, that “high food prices and no jobs could
            lead to social disorder and social instability.”


            After the failure to heed those warnings, South Africa’s future is uncertain.
            The violence has damaged an already fragile economy. Gauteng and KZN account
            for half of the country’s GDP . Roughly 200 shopping centres and 3,000
            shops were ransacked. Several small towns in KZN lost nearly all of their
            shops. In townships the economic self-harm has flabbergasted some residents.
            “We destroyed the amenities we had fought so hard for,” says Richard Yangaphi
            of Alexandra.


            In KZN alone 150,000 jobs may be at risk. One supermarket employee, Mike
            Nkwana, has not worked since rioting destroyed his workplace, so has been
            unable to feed his children. He brings up the added impact of “the black
            tax”: on average one South African wage supports the livelihoods of 4.3
            people, a burden disproportionately shouldered by black employees. “I
            don’t only look after my family,” he says.


            Guns n’ hoses


            Firms will ponder the risk of further unrest when making investment decisions.
            Toyota, which has a plant in Durban, told the municipality that it was
            “feeling very uncertain about the future of our business in KwaZulu-Natal”.
            Traders who rely on the port may look to alternatives such as Dar es Salaam
            in Tanzania. Emigration enquiries have reportedly soared.


            Those who stay may take extra precautions. Denzil Smith, a B & B owner
            in Pietermaritzburg with a fondness for Victorian knick-knacks, is not
            your natural vigilante. “But after this I’m definitely getting a gun,”
            he says. South Africa’s “enclave society”, as Frans Cronje, a political
            analyst, calls it, may take deeper root.


            There will be political effects, too. If Mr Ramaphosa does not push Zuma-era
            figures out of the party, they may jump. “The violence, looting and arson
            of the past week will change the ANC for ever,” argues William Gumede,
            a former anti-apartheid activist and commentator. “It has hastened the
            [Zuma] faction’s own departure from the ANC .” If Mr Zuma’s supporters
            flee the party, that would probably mean losses for the ANC in KZN at
            local elections scheduled for October (though they may be delayed by covid-19).
            Whether it would cause losses elsewhere is less clear. “People don’t feel
            they have a lot of options,” notes Ms Ntuli.


            Even so, the unrest may speed the ANC ’s secular decline. Polling suggests
            that fewer than half of 15- to 50-year-olds support the party. Its voters
            are increasingly old and rural in a young and urban country. The ANC looks
            ever more like Zimbabwe’s Zanu- PF and other “liberation” parties in southern
            Africa, which depend on rural voters (and rigging) to win elections. Mr
            Ramaphosa may be the last ANC leader with a national majority. That could
            mean a coalition of moderate elements from the ANC and DA . But it could
            also pave the way for the entry of left-wing populism exploiting the country’s
            poverty, or a right-wing version playing on fears of crime and xenophobia.


            The two South Africas


            Is there reason for optimism? South Africa has defied the odds before.
            It did not descend into violence, as some feared, after 1994. Desmond
            Tutu’s commission brought some truth and a little reconciliation. Just
            18% of South Africans feel there has been no progress at reconciliation
            since the end of apartheid, according to a survey in 2019. “A vast majority
            of South Africans are proud to be South African,” it concluded. An imaginative
            politician could galvanise the country’s pragmatism and patriotism.


            Such spirit was on show in townships after the chaos subsided. In Alexandra
            two young residents joined hundreds in a clean-up. Talia Mogano, 17, says
            of the looters: “Life isn’t fair, yes, but what they did wasn’t right
            either. They should have had a protest but what they did was a crime.”
            Her friend, Thabang Kanetsi, is buoyed by the many who have risen at dawn
            to collect brooms and bin bags. “Everything is going to go back to normal,”
            he says. “I have faith in this community and this country.” But South
            Africa’s problem is that going back to normal may not be enough. '

        title: The countries of the Middle East and north Africa are parched
        text: 'I N THE NEIGHBOURHOOD of Algiers where the presidential palace and
            foreign embassies are located, some think the water pressure has increased
            of late. But don’t tell those living in the suburbs of Algeria’s capital,
            where the taps have been dry for days, as temperatures and tempers rise.
            Protesters have blocked main roads and railways. “If the water stops flowing,
            so will everything else,” says a local journalist, conveying the protesters’
            mindset.

            Algeria is not alone. In the past few months protests over water shortages
            have erupted in Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Yemen. Two protesters were shot
            dead in Iran on July 16th. And a lack of water is contributing to unrest
            elsewhere in the Middle East and north Africa.


            Drought has been a feature of the region since biblical times. But now
            climate change is causing longer dry seasons, as well as hotter heatwaves
            and record-setting temperature spikes. Rainfall is expected to decline,
            precipitously in some places, leaving farmers to dig more wells, draining
            aquifers and causing potentially irreversible environmental damage. For
            most of the region the trend is towards a drier, hotter, more miserable
            future.


            Some governments are dealing with the problem. Israel and the Gulf states
            rely on desalination plants, which can run on solar power and produce
            a cubic metre of freshwater (enough for 3,000 small water bottles) for
            as little as 50 cents. But many governments are making things worse. Protesters
            blame mismanagement and corruption for much of the misery. “The water
            sector is disintegrating,” says Hassan al-Janabi, a former water minister
            in Iraq. “There will be an explosion.”


            Agriculture accounts for the overwhelming share of freshwater taken from
            ground or surface water sources globally (about 70%), says the World Bank.
            The proportion is even higher in the Middle East and north Africa (about
            80%). Crops depend entirely on irrigation in the arid region and officials
            say that supporting agriculture stems rural migration and reduces the
            need to use hard currency for food imports. So Egypt, for example, allows
            its farmers to take water from the Nile for nothing but the cost of pumping
            it.


            Such subsidies have long encouraged farmers in the region to waste water
            on a massive scale. Still, leaders like to use cheap water as a way to
            buy support or further their own interests. The regime in Jordan, one
            of the world’s driest countries, uses it to mollify farmers from powerful
            tribes in the Jordan valley. In Iran the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
            rerouted a river to cool its steel mills in Isfahan. A former president,
            Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, is even said to have built a dam to water his
            pistachio crop.


            The protests in Iran have occurred in Khuzestan, home to most of the country’s
            Arabs. Much of Iran’s fresh water used to flow through the province. Old-timers
            remember when ships bound for America sailed up the Karun river. But dozens
            of dams have dried up Khuzestan’s rivers and marshes. Angry residents
            accuse the clerical regime of diverting water to Persian cities and seeking
            to drive Arabs off the land in order to drill for more oil. “No to forced
            migration,” chant protesters.


            Those in Algeria often blame corruption for their water woes. The government
            has spent more than $50bn on water projects over the past two decades,
            but much of it has evaporated. One former minister of water resources
            has been sentenced to jail for pilfering funds and in recent weeks two
            more have been arrested. Ten of the 11 desalination plants built by a
            state subsidiary are in disrepair. The story is much the same in Iraq,
            where the construction of a large desalination plant has been delayed
            for years as the country’s ruling factions bicker over who gets the contract.


            War has made it hard for some countries to maintain water infrastructure.
            And water is sometimes used as a weapon. The jihadists of Islamic State
            tried to dam the Euphrates in order to starve their opponents in Iraq.
            Turkish-backed rebels in northern Syria have stopped operating a water
            plant that supplies the bread basket of their rivals, the Kurds. A report
            by the University of Sana’a estimated that 70% of the rural skirmishes
            in Yemen, before the civil war, began as disputes over water.


            Water could even become the main cause of future conflicts. Egypt and
            Sudan are feuding with Ethiopia over its filling of a giant dam on the
            Nile. “All options are open,” says Egypt’s president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi,
            menacingly. Turkey and Iran are also building dams that will deplete the
            water flowing to Arab countries. Israel’s blockade of Gaza ensures that
            the territory does not have the means to produce enough potable water.


            Other observers, though, are more sanguine. It’s cheaper to desalinate
            water than to fight over it, says Eran Feitelson of Israel’s Hebrew University.
            Still, unrest related to water could have global consequences. Yemenis,
            for example, are already abandoning parched villages. Without better sharing,
            management and investment, millions of the region’s residents risk becoming
            climate refugees.

            IN THE DUNES north of Riyadh, the Saudi capital, the sun sets and the
            party begins. Girls discard their abayas, the black shrouds that envelop
            them in public, and begin jiving to techno music with boys. A few swig
            from bottles, but most prefer Captagon pills, nowadays the Gulf’s favourite
            drug, at $25 a pop. They call it Abu Hilalain (Father of Two Half-moons),
            after the two letter “c”s (for Captagon) embossed on the pills. Part of
            the amphetamine family, it can have a similar effect to Viagra—and conquers
            sleep. “With one pill,” says a raver, “we can dance all weekend.”


            Though Saudi rulers have opposed the regime in Syria for a decade, the
            pill-popping by young people is funding it. For Syria’s president, Bashar
            al-Assad, the drug has become a boon—at least in the short run. His country
            has become the world’s prime pusher of Captagon. As the formal economy
            collapses under the burden of war, sanctions and the predatory rule of
            the Assads, the drug has become Syria’s main export and source of hard
            currency. The Centre for Operational Analysis and Research (COAR), a Cyprus-based
            consultancy, reckons that last year authorities elsewhere seized Syrian
            drugs with a street value of no less than $3.4bn. That compares with Syria’s
            largest legal export, olive oil, which is worth some $122m a year. The
            drug is financing the central government, says Ian Larson, who wrote a
            recent report on the subject for COAR.


            Syria has long been involved in drugs. In the 1990s, when it ruled Lebanon,
            the Bekaa valley was the region’s main source of hashish. But mass production
            of drugs within Syria began only after the civil war erupted in 2011.
            Officers fed their men “Captain Courage”, as they called Captagon. Shia
            fighters from Afghanistan and Lebanon, who came to support the Syrian
            regime, brought their skills in making and trafficking drugs. Hizbullah,
            Lebanon’s biggest Shia militia, which has given crucial support to the
            Assad regime, acquired large tracts across the border in Syria’s Qalamoun
            mountains. They expanded hashish cultivation and developed a new cottage
            industry, making Captagon pills.


            Syria began exporting them in about 2013, as its formal economy shrivelled,
            thanks to war, economic sanctions and corruption within the regime. Chemical
            plants in the cities of Aleppo and Homs have been converted into pill
            factories. In the Gulf the mark-up for pills can be 50 times their cost
            in Syria. Smugglers hide them in shipments of paper rolls, parquet flooring
            and even pomegranates. Saudi princes use private jets to bring the stuff
            in.


            Seizures by police in foreign waters testify to the size of the trade.
            Italian police last year uncovered 84m pills worth over €1bn on a single
            ship. It was then said to be the world’s biggest interception of amphetamine-related
            drugs. In May the Malaysian authorities, acting on a Saudi tip-off, seized
            95m pills. The Libyan port of Benghazi, linked by a regular shipping route
            to Syria, is said to be a key entrepot.'

        title: Jordan’s jailing of a courtier exposes fissures in the kingdom
        text: 'F OR KING ABDULLAH it is like old times. On July 19th he will be back
            in the White House, the first Arab leader to meet the new president. Gone
            are the cast of old antagonists, Donald Trump and his chum, Binyamin Netanyahu.
            President Joe Biden has ditched Mr Trump’s “deal-of-the-century” for Arab-Israeli
            peace, which had sidelined Jordan and its king. Naftali Bennett made Amman,
            Jordan’s capital, his first foreign destination as Israel’s new prime
            minister. Without Mr Trump’s support, Saudi Arabia has backed off from
            trying to supplant Jordan as the custodian of Jerusalem’s holy sites.
            Confident of this geopolitical realignment in Jordan’s favour, Abdullah
            and his queen, Rania, have taken a three-week jaunt around America.

            Back home, though, Jordan is seething. Bedouin tribes, historically the
            regime’s bedrock, openly challenge the king, who has reigned for 22 years.
            “I’ve never seen such dissent,” says a former official. “It’s seeping
            into the heart of the system itself.”


            On July 12th Jordan’s State Security Court sentenced two of the king’s
            former confidants, Bassem Awadallah and Sharif Hassan bin Zeid, to 15
            years in prison for plotting against the monarch. The trial was quick,
            closed and devoid of key witnesses. No army officers were charged, casting
            doubt on the prosecution’s claim that a coup was being planned. Lawyers
            for the accused could not call as a witness the alleged chief protagonist,
            Prince Hamzah, the king’s half-brother, because he is under house arrest.


            Instead of uniting Jordan behind the king, the case has inflamed tensions.
            Several Bedouin tribes, a minority who fear losing their dominance to
            the descendants of Palestinians, have pledged their allegiance to the
            prince. One of their parliamentarians led protests waving a sword. (He
            was subsequently jailed for threatening to shoot the king.) Protesters
            praise Hamzah’s fluent Arabic, deep tribal connections and facial resemblance
            to their beloved former king, Hussein, and deride Abdullah’s Western upbringing
            and ties by marriage to Jordan’s Palestinian majority. They call him an
            American lackey and chant in English—“so he’ll understand”.


            In the past the king (pictured below) has bought off the tribes by offering
            them jobs in the security forces. But the country’s economic woes are
            stoking anger. Covid-19 has hit the mainstays of tourism and remittances.
            Oil-rich Gulf states have been cutting aid and investment. Debt is set
            to reach 118% of GDP this year. Almost two-thirds of young Jordanians
            are jobless.


            With no vision for recovery, the king rarely addresses his nation. America
            already gives $1.5bn annually (making the country America’s second-largest
            recipient of aid). Israel has direct flights to the Gulf and no longer
            needs Jordan as a stepping stone to the Arab world and beyond. For appearances
            ahead of his visit to America, the king has appointed a commission stacked
            with toadies to consider political reform. But he prefers to stifle dissent
            than listen to it. He closes trade unions and curbs civil liberties. This
            year Freedom House, a think-tank in Washington, downgraded Jordan’s ranking
            from “Partly Free” to “Not Free”. The king’s meeting with Mr Biden may
            offer him a photo opportunity. It will not cure his country’s ills. '

        title: Israel is being forced to choose between America and China
        text: 'T HE ADVISORY Committee to Inspect National Security Aspects of Foreign
            Investments is the dull title for one of the more secret and sensitive
            bodies in the Israeli government. Its membership is unknown and meetings
            are held under a blanket of opacity. It is essentially a committee to
            assess deals with China. It was set up in 2020 after pressure from America,
            which was concerned that China could be getting Israeli weapons technology.
            The committee’s chilling effect on trade and ties with China is already
            being felt.

            Although there is no official policy or written directive banning Chinese
            investments in key areas of the economy, there has been a marked slowdown
            in new deals. “The Americans made it clear to us that they would not accept
            any Chinese involvement in critical infrastructure and Israel belatedly
            got the message,” says a former Israeli minister in the government that
            left office on June 13th.


            In May 2020, for instance, Israel rejected a bid by Hutchison Water, a
            Chinese firm, to build a desalination plant. Chinese firms are still involved
            in previously signed infrastructure projects, including the new Tel Aviv
            light-rail network. But Israel, under American pressure, is discreetly
            trying to replace the Shanghai International Port Group, which is set
            to manage a new container terminal in Haifa Port, with an Emirati company.


            “In the past we got a lot less guidance from the government on how to
            do business with China,” says one Israeli executive who has spent over
            a decade working on Chinese investment. “Now things are a lot clearer.
            They can invest in fields like foodtech and fintech, but not in anything
            cyber- or security-related and not in infrastructure.” Chinese investment
            in Israeli tech companies has fallen from 72 deals in 2018 to 45 in 2020.
            This can be explained partly by the pandemic and new regulations within
            China on foreign-currency transfers, but also by what one Israeli diplomat
            calls the “recalibration of relations”.'

            These are unlikely bedfellows. Yet they are entrusted with the task of
            building democracy in Sudan. Barely two years after a ruthless Islamist
            despot, Omar al-Bashir, was deposed, they are supposed to be shepherding
            the country towards elections in 2024. “We call it the Sudan model,” smiles
            Abdalla Hamdok, the economist (below left). He is the prime minister appointed
            by protest leaders in 2019. “A model of partnership between civilians
            and the military, paradoxically, to bring democracy.”


            That model emerged from a power-sharing pact struck in 2019 between leaders
            of the protesters, who had first taken to the streets eight months earlier,
            and the generals who had tossed out Mr Bashir when it became clear he
            would fall. At the top is Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan (centre), Sudan’s de
            facto president and chairman of the sovereign council, a military and
            civilian body that oversees Mr Hamdok’s mostly civilian cabinet. Burhan
            is a general who rose to prominence under Mr Bashir.


            Beneath him is a desert warlord, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti).
            He heads the Rapid Support Forces ( RSF ), a paramilitary unit that grew
            out of the Janjaweed, militias notorious for rape and butchery of civilians
            in the Darfur region. Mr Dagalo (pictured right), now deputy chairman,
            rose to power through ruthlessness towards rebellious Sudanese. Today
            he is jostling for primacy in a struggle that may determine whether Sudan’s
            third attempt at democracy since independence from Britain in 1956 also
            ends in failure.


            Each tells The Economist that the spirit of unity is undimmed. “All components
            of the transition work together in harmony,” says General Burhan. As evidence
            he points to successes: a peace deal signed with armed rebels, and the
            repeal of repressive laws, such as one that banned women from wearing
            immodest clothing.


            General Burhan also highlights the restoration of full ties with America
            and Israel, which prompted America to remove Sudan from its list of state
            sponsors of terrorism. This has paved the way for Sudan to win relief
            on more than $56bn of its debt. “Our international isolation of more than
            30 years is now over,” says the general.


            But behind the façade of camaraderie tension runs deep. Speaking more
            candidly than his colleagues, Mr Hamdok warns of a “political crisis”
            stemming from three challenges that could derail the transition. The first
            is division among civilian leaders. “This was probably the broadest coalition
            the country has seen for decades,” Mr Hamdok explains. “It managed to
            topple the dictatorship. But immediately afterwards we started seeing
            cracks and divisions.” Several of its members have withdrawn from the
            coalition and returned to the streets. Those that remain squabble over
            jobs and government portfolios. Critics blame Mr Hamdok’s aloof and timid
            governing style for failing to maintain unity.


            The fragmentation makes it harder for the civilians to handle the prime
            minister’s second challenge: to rein in the army. Mr Hamdok says he had
            “very frank discussions” with the generals early on about the army’s excessive
            power over the economy. General Burhan says this has ended, but that stretches
            credulity. Several firms which used to belong to Mr Bashir’s family, for
            instance, now belong to the army. General Burhan, meanwhile, has emerged
            as the most powerful and effective of the three. He has muscled in on
            foreign policy, which is Mr Hamdok’s job. He has strengthened Sudan’s
            relationship with Egypt and overridden civilian objections to the deal
            with Israel last year. He has also burnished the army’s nationalist credentials
            by taking back control of disputed territory on the border with Ethiopia.
            “Burhan is a shrewd general,” says Yasir Arman, a former rebel who is
            now advising Mr Hamdok. “He bought time to shore up the army’s position.
            And now it is stronger than ever.” But General Burhan’s assertiveness
            may have exacerbated the third problem Mr Hamdok identifies: fragmentation
            within the armed forces, and competition between the army and the paramilitary
            RSF . Created by Mr Bashir as a counterweight to the army and the intelligence
            service, the RSF has its own command structure and funding. As part of
            the power-sharing deal, Mr Dagalo is supposed to integrate his forces
            into the army, which would mean giving up some of his power. The general
            says this will happen “in the right time”. Mr Dagalo insists it has already
            happened. But this superficial harmony could quickly evaporate. In June
            the RSF and the army began barricading their respective headquarters in
            Khartoum with sandbags. “It had reached a point where they could have
            been killing each other on the streets,” says Shaddad Hamid Mauwid, an
            academic at Khartoum University. Talks between General Burhan and Mr Dagalo
            have since calmed nerves. Some reckon the general may have agreed to postpone
            integration indefinitely. Yet that would put him at odds with Mr Hamdok,
            who feels Sudan should “have one national army”.


            Big questions remain about Mr Dagalo. Few doubt he has presidential ambitions.
            (Over a sumptuous breakfast at his home he tells The Economist he has
            been taking English and French lessons.) But his footing looks a bit shaky.
            Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which used to pay for thousands
            of his soldiers to fight in Yemen, no longer have much use for him. And
            the death of Chad’s dictator, Idriss Déby, has deprived him of another
            regional ally. Recent visits to both Qatar and Turkey suggest he is seeking
            new friends.


            Perhaps in a sign of anxiety, Mr Dagalo warns of a “coup” by people tied
            to the old regime. Though this is unlikely, Islamists from Mr Bashir’s
            former party may conceivably ally with factions in the army to force Mr
            Dagalo out, notes Jean-Baptiste Gallopin, a French researcher. This could
            set off fighting across Sudan. Yet other observers believe Mr Dagalo himself
            would pose a bigger threat to the transition, should he fear for his economic
            interests—or his freedom. An investigation into a massacre of over 100
            protesters in 2019 may point the finger at his gunmen.


            Mr Hamdok has been sounding the alarm. In June he warned of civil war
            if the armed factions are not unified in a single army. He has set a deadline
            for forming a legislature with civilians in charge and called for a constitutional
            convention to clarify the place of the army in politics. “For all the
            years since independence to today, we have been dominated by the military,”
            he says. The civilians have a chance to reverse this. But only a fleeting
            one. '

            But then come Sudanese soldiers. One is on a tractor. Another walks through
            a field, cigarette in one hand, rifle in the other. Tanks face east towards
            Ethiopia.


            For eight months this slice of fertile farmland known as al-Fashaga has
            been on a war footing. Army camps have sprung up across fields of sesame
            and sorghum. There are thought to be tens of thousands of soldiers on
            the Sudanese side. Nobody knows how many have been deployed by the Ethiopians.
            But after months of skirmishes and some small battles, many fret that
            just one spark could trigger a full-blown war.


            The conflict dates back to the early 20th century, when the British who
            then ruled in Khartoum signed border treaties with Ethiopia placing al-Fashaga
            inside Sudan. Ethiopia has long disputed them. But an uneasy compromise
            established between Sudan’s former dictator, Omar al-Bashir, and Ethiopia''s
            late prime minister, Meles Zenawi, allowed Ethiopians to till the land,
            provided they recognised Sudanese ownership of the area.'

            reopen. Food, petrol and medicines are in short supply in the province
            of KwaZulu-Natal ( KZN ) and parts of Gauteng, which contains Johannesburg.
            At least 72 people have been killed and more than 1,234 arrested. The
            worst violence since the dawn of democracy in 1994 not only threatens
            the presidency of Cyril Ramaphosa but shows how his enemies can exploit
            the weakness of the post-apartheid state.


            In South Africa there are plenty of sources of discontent. The official
            unemployment rate is the highest in the world, according to the World
            Bank. Gaping inequality means a minority enjoys a rich-world standard
            of living while most people struggle to get by. Parts of the country regularly
            go without power and water. The police are a blend of incompetence and
            cruelty. The pandemic has made life harder in every way. And when corruption
            is rampant, some ask, what is raiding a supermarket compared with looting
            a state airline or the national energy company?


            But the riots are not random. They have been urged on by supporters of
            Jacob Zuma, the former president whose faction of the ruling African National
            Congress ( ANC ) wants to topple Mr Ramaphosa. On June 29th the Constitutional
            Court sentenced Mr Zuma to 15 months behind bars for refusing to appear
            before a judge-led inquiry into corruption during his time in office from
            2009-18. Just before midnight on July 7th, as the highest court’s deadline
            for the police to arrest him approached, Mr Zuma was taken into custody.
            His allies, including family members, then spread misinformation about
            the basis for his arrest and encouraged unrest. His foundation called
            it the “righteous anger of the people...which others have characterised
            as violence”, in response to the “violent provocation” of his sentencing.


            Some Zuma supporters may have done more than applaud the destruction.
            In a veiled reference to the Zulu nationalists who make up Mr Zuma’s base,
            Mr Ramaphosa said on July 12th that “there may have been some people who
            sought to agitate for violence and disorder along ethnic lines.” The next
            day, Ayanda Dlodlo, the State Security Minister, said the government was
            investigating whether former agents of the domestic spy agency and senior
            ANC members aligned with Mr Zuma had actively organised some of the violence.
            On July 14th News24, a South African outlet, reported that the government
            was looking into allegations that Thulani Dlomo, a Zuma-era spy boss and
            former ambassador, was one of the instigators. Some 25,000 troops will
            soon be deployed, said the defence minister on July 14th. They are needed.
            In KZN , Mr Zuma’s stronghold, the violence was still unabated as The
            Economist went to press. Police were conspicuous by their absence at the
            sites of some of the worst criminality. The first state of emergency since
            the apartheid era is being considered, according to government ministers.
            Several business groups are pleading for it. As is often the case, South
            Africans let down by the state are taking matters into their own hands.
            In parts of KZN, armed neighbourhood groups are controlling entry to and
            exit from their areas. The country’s many private-security firms, which
            between them have more than three times as many guards as there are police
            officers, are patrolling suburbs and defending businesses. In Johannesburg
            townships, such as Alexandra and Soweto, community groups are banding
            together to protect malls and sweep up the broken glass.


            Recovery will take years. Some South African business owners, teetering
            after years of slow growth, will give up or go overseas. Some foreign
            investors will look at the chaos, see every bad stereotype about South
            Africa confirmed, and put their money elsewhere. Already strained public
            finances will be hit by the cost of rebuilding infrastructure and of payouts
            from a state insurer used by firms to cover against riots. Even after
            trashed, burned buildings have been repaired, the damage to the social
            fabric may prove enduring.


            Mr Ramaphosa has defined his presidency as the opposite of Mr Zuma’s.
            In his speech on July 12th he told the country: “This is not who we are
            as South Africans. This is not us.” He pledged to “restore calm and order”.
            But if his government does not do so soon, it will cement the malign legacy
            of his predecessor and emphasise his own weakness. Mr Zuma may no longer
            be in charge. But is anyone?

        title: South Sudan’s second decade may be as troubled as its first
        text: 'M OST NATIONS are born in a flurry of optimism. South Sudan was no
            different. Ahead of its independence day on July 9th 2011, Salva Kiir,
            the country’s first and only president, promised his people “a just, equitable
            and prosperous nation”. Unshackled from its former overlords in the north,
            the new state would be “united and peaceful” within three years, its founding
            fathers predicted.

            If any nation deserved some slack, it was South Sudan. In the half-century
            before it seceded from Muslim-dominated Sudan its people had known little
            but war, famine and enslavement. A decade later, however, South Sudan
            is neither just, nor equitable, nor prosperous. Having scoffed at those
            who suggested that it would “slip into civil war as soon as our flag is
            hoisted” in his independence-day speech, Mr Kiir helped unleash one just
            two years later. It claimed perhaps 400,000 lives before a tenuous ceasefire
            in 2018.


            The blame for South Sudan’s tragedy does not rest only on the shoulders
            of its leaders. The country’s Western backers, particularly in America,
            were ludicrously unrealistic about what a state created from scratch,
            with little infrastructure or national identity, could achieve.


            Such was the naivety that, in the years before independence, some American
            officials took to handing out Milton Friedman’s “Capitalism and Freedom”
            to warlords preparing to swap their uniforms for suits. Others took up
            roles advising the new government on how to woo the foreign investment
            that would surely follow.


            The American advisers have since slunk away. (One now runs a distillery
            in South Carolina.) Most foreign investors, after all, shy away from war-ravaged
            states. That South Sudan is ranked the world’s sixth-hardest place to
            do business by the World Bank and sits at the bottom of Transparency International’s
            corruption index may clinch the matter for any still wavering.


            South Sudan’s leaders turned out to be neither the cuddly human-rights
            champions imagined by the American left, nor the market-loving Friedmanites
            hoped for on the right. Instead, Mr Kiir’s ruling Sudan People’s Liberation
            Movement has proved to be murderous, larcenous and incompetent, as even
            once supportive Western officials now admit. “We veer between despair
            and disgust,” says one.


            Beyond the political elite, it is hard to find many people who are better
            off than they were before independence. Few have seen any benefit from
            the country’s dwindling oil wealth. Humanitarian agencies calculate that
            a South Sudanese girl is more likely to die in childbirth than to complete
            secondary school.


            There are a few reasons for cautious optimism. In 2018 President Kiir
            and his former deputy, Riek Machar, agreed to a peace agreement that more
            or less ended the fighting between their respective tribes. Mr Machar
            was reinstalled as first vice-president. Yet killing by ethnic militias
            continues. Four aid workers have been murdered in the past two months.
            Roughly a quarter of the population is still being fed by aid agencies;
            otherwise there would be famine. The deal between the president and his
            deputy is fragile. Should South Sudan ever hold its first election (as
            it is supposed to do in December 2022), civil war could easily re-erupt.


            Such a catastrophe could be averted. Western diplomats and regional powers
            hope to persuade both sides to strike a bargain whereby election losers
            are still granted a share of power. This could be done by rotating the
            presidency among ethnic alliances and guaranteeing vice-presidential slots
            to losing parties. South Sudan is short of many things, but not of vice-presidents:
            it has five. A federal system may pacify disgruntled minority groups.


            Such reform would happen only if the president and his deputy, who both
            dream of holding untrammelled power, were persuaded to resign. That step
            might help South Sudan avoid becoming a failed state. Sadly, it seems
            most unlikely to be taken.'

        title: Mired in crisis, Lebanon begs for foreign assistance
        text: 'L EBANON IS “days away” from a “social explosion”. So said Hassan Diab,
            the acting prime minister, on July 6th. The country has been mired in
            a crisis that has seen the value of the local currency plummet and left
            much of the population short of food, fuel and medicine. “I am calling
            on kings, princes, presidents and leaders of our friendly countries, and
            I am calling on the United Nations and all international organisations…to
            help rescue Lebanon from its demise,” Mr Diab told a group of foreign
            diplomats.

            But foreign leaders are not listening. Most do not trust Lebanon’s politicians.
            Mr Diab has been serving in a caretaker role since a devastating explosion
            at Beirut’s port last August (the result of government neglect). For nearly
            a year the country’s politicians, divided by sect and notoriously corrupt,
            have failed to agree on a new government—and failed to make reforms called
            for by foreign leaders.


            Even when parliament appears to do something right, there are doubts over
            its intentions. Take its recently passed plan to replace unaffordable
            subsidies for food, fuel and medicine with a $556m programme of cash aid
            for the poor. In a sense it was following the recommendation of the World
            Bank, which predicted in December that Lebanon’s central bank (the Banque
            du Liban, or B d L ) would soon lack the reserves needed to support the
            subsidy scheme. (The scheme had the B d L selling dollars to importers
            of the covered goods at below-market rates.) The World Bank was right
            and the B d L has been removing or cutting subsidies this year.


            The old system could have been better targeted, as rich Lebanese consumed
            more of the subsidised goods than the poor. But the new system, yet to
            be implemented, is opaque. It is not clear who is eligible for the aid.
            Regardless, few people think Lebanon’s politicians will distribute it
            fairly. They have a history of doling out government largesse to their
            relatives and supporters (an election is scheduled for next year). Contracts
            go to the connected, leading to unreliable services. It is fitting that
            sweaty legislators passed the cash-aid programme in an assembly without
            working air-conditioning, the result of a decrepit and poorly managed
            power grid.


            How the cash-aid programme will be funded is also an open question. The
            central bank could pay for it, but it is running low on reserves and printing
            more pounds would increase inflation, which is already sky-high. Outside
            funding may be an option. Lebanon could, for example, use aid that the
            IMF is giving to poor countries in order to help with covid-related economic
            slowdowns. The money is expected to be delivered by the autumn. Some officials
            want to reallocate loans already given by the World Bank for other purposes.


            The World Bank probably would not mind if more of its money actually went
            to directly helping the poor. But it is running short of patience with
            the government. In January the bank agreed to lend Lebanon $246m to expand
            the social safety-net, including cash transfers for the poor. Feeding
            more money into that programme would be an option—if the government ever
            implemented it. It has been stalled for months because of a disagreement
            between the World Bank and Lebanese politicians over who gets the aid
            and how it is disbursed. In short, the politicians do not like the idea
            of World Bank oversight.


            In the coming weeks the government is supposed to present a detailed plan
            on the funding and implementation of the new aid programme. But the Lebanese
            people are not holding their breath. Poverty is rising, basic services
            are failing and politicians appear more concerned with protecting the
            patronage system that contributed to the crisis. Is it any wonder that
            Mr Diab’s pleas have fallen on deaf ears? '

        title: Morocco moves to legalise some cannabis cultivation
        text: 'F EW COUNTRIES produce more cannabis than Morocco, where locals mix
            it with tobacco and call it kif, meaning “supreme happiness”. The pleasure
            extends to Europe, where much of the cannabis ends up. Farmers in the
            Rif, a poor mountainous region in northern Morocco, produce most of the
            supply. They operate in a legal grey area. Growing cannabis is against
            the law in Morocco, but it is tolerated in the Rif.

            A bill passed by parliament, but yet to be approved by the king, may clarify
            the situation, at least somewhat. It would legalise the cultivation, use
            and export of cannabis for medical and industrial purposes (such as for
            hemp in textiles). The proposed law, though, would not legalise cannabis
            for recreational use. And it would allow cannabis farming only in certain
            regions of the country, such as the Rif.


            The Rif has little else going for it. “There’s no infrastructure, no schools,
            no hospitals, nothing—nothing except cannabis,” says Charif Adardak, who
            heads an NGO that promotes development in the Rif. It has long been a
            restive place owing to the government’s neglect and what locals call hogra
            (humiliating treatment by the state). The previous king, Hassan II, crushed
            a revolt there in the 1950s. His son, Muhammad VI, has been more conciliatory,
            backing development projects in the region.


            But King Muhammad’s plans have not got very far. Large protests by Riffians
            in recent years have at times turned violent. The region still relies
            on cannabis production. The government, in turn, sees its tolerance of
            the trade as a way to buy peace.


            One of the reasons Morocco is moving towards legalisation now is because
            in December the UN removed cannabis for medicinal use from its list of
            the most dangerous drugs. The proposed law will improve the lot of Riffians
            and free them from international drug-smuggling networks, says Abdelouafi
            Laftit, Morocco’s interior minister. Regulating the trade may also allow
            the government to curb environmental damage in the Rif, which has suffered
            from deforestation and soil degradation as farmers have adopted new, hybrid
            strains of cannabis. Many cannabis farmers in the Rif think the government
            is blowing smoke. Some fear they will be run out of business by corporations
            or well-connected businessmen who are better able to navigate the rules.
            Farmers in the Rif are unaccustomed to growing cannabis to the strict
            legal standards that importing countries often impose on the medicinal
            sort. Others worry about future competition from other regions. There
            isn’t enough demand for medical cannabis to keep even the Rif’s farmers
            in business. Cannabis is grown on 73,000 hectares of land in Morocco,
            says Tom Blickman of the Transnational Institute, a Dutch think-tank.
            Demand for medical cannabis might support between 5,000 and 8,000 hectares.
            Demand is greater for industrial cannabis, but it is of lower value. Its
            production is “about quantity not quality”, says Mr Blickman. That’s bad
            for the Rif. Tucked away in the mountains, the region’s remoteness and
            inaccessibility make it an ideal place for illicit cannabis farming. But
            the production of industrial cannabis is easier in flat areas with better
            infrastructure that can support large farms.


            People in the Rif are also frustrated that the proposed law does not provide
            amnesty for the roughly 48,000 farmers who have cannabis-related arrest
            warrants hanging over them. Some, though, see the law as a prelude to
            legalisation of recreational cannabis. That would make many Moroccans
            supremely happy. '

            the body of the 25-year-old law student was found in a field near Manzini
            in Eswatini. The police say he died in a car crash. Friends and family
            say the police killed him.

            Mr Nkomonye’s death has sparked protests across the country of 1.2m people.
            On June 29th, after demonstrations intensified, the government announced
            a dusk-to-dawn curfew and shut off the internet. Swazi journalists say
            that doctors have confirmed at least 50 deaths at the hands of security
            forces. The government says that 27 people have died and that its forces
            were defending themselves and private property against “rioters and foreign
            agents”.


            In many ways the protests are like those elsewhere in Africa. “There are
            no jobs and opportunities for young people,” says Xolani Maseko, the president
            of the union of students. More than 46% of 15- to 24-year-olds are unemployed,
            the third-highest rate in the world. What distinguishes Eswatini is the
            protests’ target, King Mswati III, Africa’s last absolute monarch.


            That he rules at all is a historical curiosity. Britain, the colonial
            power, left in 1968, perfunctorily bequeathing a Westminster-style system.
            Five years later the then king, Sobhuza II, revoked the constitution and
            declared “supreme power”. After Sobhuza died in 1982 elders of the ruling
            Dlamini clan picked as heir his 14-year-old illegitimate son, whom they
            hoped to control. The future King Mswati III was brought into the royal
            kraal, says a confidant, and told, “From now on you call your mother ‘Queen
            Mother’.” She had been a cleaner for one of Sobhuza’s 65 wives, according
            to a report published in 2013 by Freedom House, an American think-tank.
            The boy-king was sent to boarding school in England, returning to sit
            on the throne in 1986.


            Though analysts speculate about how much the king himself calls the shots,
            the monarchy certainly operates unchecked. Mswati is immune from prosecution.
            Political parties are banned. Opposition activists are jailed. Journalists
            are intimidated; on July 4th reporters from New Frame, a South African
            publication, were taken to a police station and allegedly tortured with
            plastic bags over their heads. The king (pictured on next page) appoints
            the prime minister and other key office-holders.


            Most Swazis are poor but the king’s fortune, which in 2014 Forbes magazine
            estimated was “at least” $50m, was sufficient to buy a fleet of Rolls-Royces.
            That does not include Tibiyo, a trust ostensibly held by the monarchy
            on behalf of the people, but which critics say benefits the royals. It
            controls tracts of land and, according to Freedom House, has stakes in
            sugar, manufacturing, property and other firms.


            The king has defenders. “Every morning I’m grateful to wake up and see
            that the king is still on the throne,” says Andre le Roux, a fourth-generation
            (white) Swazi who runs a timber firm, Montigny, and the main business
            lobby. His worry is not the monarch, who he says ensures stability, but
            an “enterprise-throttling” civil service.


            Neal Rijkenberg, the founder of Montigny, who was appointed finance minister
            in 2018, says the country is “surprisingly democratic”. For example, the
            king must get parliament to approve his budget and must use his own money
            to pay for posh cars, he argues. What about the 340m lilangeni ($24m)
            annual stipend? That pays for tourist-pleasing cultural events. And appointing
            a princess to the cabinet? “There are many children he hasn’t given jobs
            to.”


            Mr Rijkenberg’s appointment, alongside others in a “cabinet of CEO s”,
            was perhaps a sign of the king’s fears. Manqoba Khumalo, the commerce
            minister, was poached from Coca-Cola. “It’s like when your mother asks
            you to do something, but times a thousand,” he says. The king is worried
            about youth unemployment, he adds. “He didn’t articulate it as a political
            threat but he probably sees it that way.”


            Opponents argue that the king can never be a reformer. “He makes it impossible
            to run a state professionally, ethically and efficiently,” says Wandile
            Dludlu of the banned opposition party, PUDEMO . “There is no clear distinction
            between private and public resources.” Sibongile Mazibuko, another activist,
            argues that whereas the killing of George Floyd in America was “a white
            knee on a black neck, here it is a black knee on a black neck.”


            “Because it is out of the spotlight, Eswatini gets away with a lot,” says
            a former diplomat. There are just eight missions in the country. After
            South Africa, on which Eswatini depends economically, the most important
            may be Taiwan. Mswati’s government is the last in Africa with which it
            has diplomatic relations. That has resulted in an upside-down situation
            in which Taiwan lavishes aid to maintain an autocratic status quo while
            accusing China of being on the side of pro-democracy activists.


            The crackdown may quell protests for a while. But it seems that the king’s
            popularity is waning. In 2015, according to Afrobarometer, a pollster,
            79% of Swazis said they trusted him. Earlier this year the share was 50%.
            Large majorities said they supported multi-party democracy and wanted
            to choose their leader, suggesting a preference for, at least, a constitutional
            monarchy. And the longer his regime silences Swazis, the more likely it
            is that they will decide they do not need a king at all.

        title: Can America and Iran revive their nuclear deal?
        text: 'T HE GRAND HOTEL on Vienna’s Ringstrasse, the city’s elegant main boulevard,
            is a felicitous spot for nuclear diplomacy. It is not just the opulent
            surroundings or the unlimited coffee. The hotel was also the headquarters
            of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ), the world’s nuclear
            watchdog, for 22 years until 1979. Yet the diplomats who have gathered
            there for six rounds of talks since April, most recently on June 20th,
            have had little luck so far. And time may be running short.

            America and Iran—indirectly, via Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia
            and the European Union—are discussing how to revive the multinational
            nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPOA
            ), that was signed in 2015 and abandoned by President Donald Trump three
            years later. In response to American sanctions, Iran has breached the
            deal’s provisions by testing advanced centrifuges and accumulating enriched
            uranium, among other forbidden steps. The IAEA estimated in May that Iran
            had produced over 3,000kg of uranium enriched up to 5% purity (see chart),
            enough for several bombs if enriched further. Over 70kg is now also enriched
            to over 20%, which is most of the way to weapons-grade.


            Over the past year America, under President Joe Biden, and Iran have each
            said that they are willing to return to the terms of the original deal
            if the other does so, too. “We think almost all the agreement documents
            are ready,” said Iran’s deputy foreign minister after the latest round.
            There is “a new level of optimism”, enthused the EU ’s envoy to the UN
            on June 30th. Russia’s foreign ministry reckons that a deal may be done
            by July 14th, the JCPOA ’s sixth anniversary. Yet reinstating the original
            terms is not as easy as it sounds, since circumstances have changed so
            much in six years.


            It does not help that Iran is in the midst of a political transition.
            Ebrahim Raisi, a hardline nationalist, is due to replace Hassan Rouhani,
            a pragmatist, as Iran’s president on August 3rd. Mr Raisi and his allies
            are more hostile to America and the West than the current government is.
            That does not mean a deal is impossible—it was, after all, another hardline
            president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who began the talks that eventually led
            to the JCPOA . But Mr Raisi’s election does complicate things.


            Mr Rouhani’s government has “very little incentive” to devote its last
            month in office to frantic diplomacy, says Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi of the
            Royal United Services Institute, a British think-tank. Any political rewards
            would be distant, since the next election—for Iran’s parliament—is not
            due for three years. Nor is there any guarantee that the new government
            will fully implement any deal it inherits, says Dr Tabrizi.


            Iran’s domestic politics are not the only hurdle in the way of an agreement.
            “We still have serious differences that have not been bridged,” warned
            a senior American official speaking anonymously to reporters last month.
            “Whether it’s the nuclear steps that Iran needs to take to come back into
            compliance, the sanctions relief that the US will be offering, or the
            sequence of steps that both sides would be taking.”


            Both sides now accept that they could return to the deal in a series of
            concurrent steps rather than waiting for the other to do everything first.
            But Iran has said it wants America to remove all sanctions imposed by
            Mr Trump. America retorts that it will only lift those covered by the
            JCPOA . In March the Biden administration imposed new sanctions on two
            members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It is those sorts of
            sanctions, “economically inconsequential but highly politically sensitive”,
            that are most challenging, says Henry Rome of the Eurasia Group, a consultancy.
            They include America’s labelling of the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist
            group, and sanctions against Mr Raisi himself.


            On June 30th Majid Takht Ravanchi, Iran’s ambassador to the UN , said
            that the country wanted “assurances that...the US will not, once again,
            withdraw from the JCPOA ”. American officials say it would be impossible
            to provide such certainty, not least because the JCPOA could not be turned
            into a binding treaty without support from two-thirds of the Senate. Republicans,
            who make up half the assembly, bitterly oppose the deal. In any case,
            Mr Trump also showed that a president could walk away from long-standing
            treaties.


            Western countries have their own complaints. They argue that although
            Iran has portrayed its breaches of the deal as remedial and reversible,
            it has also gained valuable knowledge by, among other things, operating
            advanced centrifuges and manufacturing uranium metal (the solid form used
            in reactors or bombs, as opposed to the gaseous compound used during enrichment).
            The JCPOA was supposed to defer such activity to later years, thus slowing
            Iran’s nuclear progress. America now wants Iran to agree to follow-on
            talks that would not only extend the deal’s provisions but also cover
            issues such as Iran’s ballistic missiles and support for militant groups
            in the region. Mr Raisi says those things are “non-negotiable”.


            The impasse is especially dangerous because Iran is determined to build
            up its leverage, not only by steadily expanding its nuclear activity,
            thus shrinking the time it would take to build a bomb, but also by threatening
            to make its programme less transparent. In February Iran repudiated several
            of the JCPOA ’s tough inspection provisions, such as the installation
            of cameras at nuclear sites, but promptly agreed to a “temporary technical
            understanding” with the IAEA to preserve some access.


            Those stop-gap measures were renewed twice but expired on June 24th, days
            after the latest talks in Vienna ended. Iran’s government has yet to decide
            whether to extend them—and hints that it may delete the data on cameras.
            The intention may be to make America sweat, but it certainly erodes trust.
            On July 1st Reuters, a news agency, reported that Iran had restricted
            the IAEA ’s access to Natanz, its main enrichment site, following suspected
            Israeli sabotage there in April.


            For all the positive talk emanating from Vienna, there is also anxiety
            about how high the stakes are becoming. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s envoy,
            says renewing the Iran- IAEA understanding would ”avoid uncertainties
            which can have unjustifiable long-lasting negative effects”. Mark Fitzpatrick,
            a retired American diplomat, is blunter: “Iran is playing with fire.”

        title: China’s globetrotting students are getting back on the road
        text: 'Q IN YIBO is half way through a science degree at the University of
            Auckland in New Zealand. But she has not been in the country since early
            2020 when it closed its borders to prevent the spread of covid-19 (she
            was back in China at the time). Instead the university has arranged for
            Ms Qin and other stranded students in China to take up residence on campuses
            in their own country while they continue their studies remotely. Ms Qin
            has thought about transferring permanently to a Chinese university, but
            she still plans to return to New Zealand when it eases its border controls.

            Ms Qin is relatively lucky. She has enjoyed seeing parts of her country
            that she had not visited previously. She spent the early months of this
            year at a university in Heilongjiang, a north-eastern province with bitter
            winters. Then, for a change of scenery, she moved to a campus in Fujian
            in the balmy south. Many thousands of Chinese students who had not yet
            enrolled at universities abroad when the pandemic began have found their
            plans upended by covid-related travel restrictions. Universities in the
            West have lived in fear that young Chinese, whose tuition fees are a lucrative
            source of revenue, would give up the dream of studying aboard.


            There are good reasons for Western universities to be anxious. In 2019
            around 700,000 Chinese headed abroad to study, more than three times the
            number a decade earlier. Most joined universities in English-speaking
            countries. Chinese students have had several reasons to reconsider their
            destinations. Foreign travel is difficult during a pandemic, and covid
            is still rife in Western countries. China has grown more unpopular in
            recent years, and some Chinese people in the West have suffered racist
            abuse. Anti-Western sentiment has also been rising in China, sometimes
            stoked by ruling-party propaganda. Many Chinese chafe at Westerners who
            blame China for its initial cover-up of covid, or who fail to give it
            credit for its subsequent success in curbing the virus.


            But the pandemic’s impact on Chinese demand for study abroad has not been
            as bad as many had predicted. Before the crisis about 370,000 Chinese
            were studying at American universities, where they made up about a third
            of foreign students. In 2020 the number of Chinese enrolled, including
            those studying online from abroad, fell by around 15%. That is not the
            collapse that some in the industry had predicted, says Martin McFarlane
            of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The fall was caused
            almost entirely by a reduction in the number of foreign students starting
            new courses, which now seems to be rebounding. The Institute of International
            Education, an American NGO , says that this autumn the number of foreigners
            who began studying at American universities for the first time was only
            9% lower than in 2019 (though about 35% were taking their classes online).


            Australia has kept its borders shut to most foreign students throughout
            the pandemic. Even now, roughly half of them are studying online from
            outside the country, including about 65% of those from China. Yet, in
            Australia, total Chinese enrolment in higher education has fallen only
            7%. Chinese students—nervous of the virus but keen to burnish their CV
            s with a Western degree—have proven more willing to put up with online
            learning than peers of other nationalities. Enrolments by Indians, for
            whom in-person classes are a high priority, have fallen by more than a
            third.


            Britain’s universities have fared the best. The number of Chinese students
            was rising fast in the years leading up to the pandemic. This summer the
            country began allowing foreigners to remain longer after graduation to
            work or look for a job. Britain’s rules on post-study employment are now
            among the most permissive in the West. Since the pandemic began, Britain’s
            borders have stayed mostly open to foreign students, as long as they are
            willing to endure quarantine. In 2020 the number of Chinese accepted for
            undergraduate studies increased by 30%. This year the number of Chinese
            applying to start undergraduate courses rose again, by 17%.


            In some countries, Chinese demand for tertiary education may yet falter.
            America is likely to remain the single most-popular destination for several
            more years. It is still widely regarded in China as having the largest
            number of great universities. But some Chinese have been put off studying
            in America by the xenophobic rhetoric of American officials during Donald
            Trump’s presidency, which fuelled perceptions of Chinese as potential
            spies. Such concerns may have abated a bit since Joe Biden took over.
            But surveys of Chinese considering study in America have shown that they
            view America’s handling of covid as the worst in the English-speaking
            world. Chinese students show growing interest in studying in Asia, says
            Simon Emmett of IDP , a multinational agency that helps universities recruit
            them. Asian countries are deemed to have a better record with covid.


            In Australia there have been big falls in the number of Chinese students
            taking non-degree courses such as English-language lessons, says Peter
            Hurley of Victoria University’s Mitchell Institute, a think-tank in Melbourne.
            Students often use these courses as preparation for study at Australian
            universities. This may suggest that Chinese enrolment at universities
            in Australia will keep on falling, at least for a while, even after the
            country reopens.


            In China there is another indication of unsettled demand. A large share
            of the Chinese who leave the country to study commit to doing so at the
            end of their compulsory education, when they are about 15. At that stage
            they opt out of preparation for China’s university-entrance exam and instead
            join senior high schools that offer curriculums focused on study abroad.
            Francis Miller, a college counsellor at one such school in the city of
            Xi’an, says the number of 15-year-olds entering its international programme
            fell sharply in 2020, before recovering somewhat this year. He thinks
            other, similar schools are having a harder time recruiting students. Xiaofeng
            Wan, who manages international admissions at Amherst College in America,
            notes that last year more Chinese children than usual elected to sit the
            entrance exam for senior secondary schools. Pupils aiming to study abroad
            sometimes skip this.


            There are other, long-term, challenges. The number of Chinese of university
            age is no longer growing. Amid economic headwinds, fewer families will
            have the resources to splash out on foreign tuition. Meanwhile, China’s
            own universities are improving. About 47m people are enrolled in tertiary
            education there, up from around 6m in 1998. Before the pandemic an expert
            at the British Council, a state-funded cultural organisation, estimated
            that the number of Chinese seeking a foreign degree could start falling
            in 2023.


            China does not appear keen to deter study abroad. During the pandemic
            Chinese officials have supported foreign universities’ efforts to help
            Chinese students continue their studies online, says Brett Berquist of
            the University of Auckland. The Chinese government has stopped issuing
            passports to most people, but has given them to those planning to study
            abroad.


            Officials still want clever young Chinese to get the best training in
            science, medicine and engineering, wherever in the world it can be found.
            After all, about 80% of such students return to China after graduating.
            For many of them, China’s allure ultimately trumps the West’s. '

            In many countries, birders play an important role in spotting changes
            in bird populations and avian behaviour. A British enthusiast in Beijing,
            Terry Townshend, has recently set up a means of doing so without needing
            to stand for hours outdoors. It involves a digital listening device, installed
            on the roof of a 15-storey building in northern Beijing. For several months
            until mid-November it recorded the night-time calls of migratory birds
            flying above. The sounds will be used to identify night-flying species,
            some of which are not commonly seen overhead by day. The technique has
            been used in America and Europe, but Mr Townshend thinks this is its first
            known application in Asia.


            Such dedication is rare among amateurs. China has little history of birdwatching.
            Only in the 19th century, led by Western ornithologists, did the scientific
            study of birds begin. Birdwatching as a pastime has emerged only in the
            past two decades, helped by rising incomes that have allowed people to
            buy spotting scopes, binoculars and cameras.


            In other countries, enthusiasts have played a big role in drawing public
            attention to human threats to birds. Chinese officials sometimes pay attention
            to gentle recommendations about ways to improve the environment. But they
            frown on activism. So harm caused to birds or their habitats can go unremarked.
            One British birder laments the recent draining of supposedly protected
            paddies by the Wenyu, a river in Beijing that had been a place of rest
            for about 200 migratory species.


            Birdwatching groups in China mostly avoid campaigning. Many of their members
            stick to taking photographs and do not even bother with binoculars. There
            is, however, a small but growing number of local birders who closely monitor
            bird migration. Mr Townshend’s listening device may provide other valuable
            insights. He plans to install more. '

        title: What Peng Shuai reveals about one-party rule
        text: 'I T IS HARD to see a good ending to the story of Peng Shuai, a Chinese
            tennis champion who on November 2nd accused a former Communist Party grandee
            more than twice her age of subjecting her to a coercive sexual relationship.
            In theory, the party deplores all immorality in office. When it suits
            the regime, propaganda outlets denounce purged officials for keeping mistresses
            as well as taking bribes. But China’s rulers care still more about asserting
            their authority, and their exclusive right to decide which rotten corners
            of their system to expose and which to keep hidden.

            Ms Peng, who is 35, was doomed from the moment she posted her late-night
            essay. In it she accuses a former member of the party’s most powerful
            body, the Politburo Standing Committee, of imposing unwanted sex on her
            during an on-off decade-long affair. It is not the writing of an anti-party
            dissident. It is personal, even anguished in tone. It is filled with appeals
            to her alleged abuser, Zhang Gaoli, a former deputy prime minister in
            his mid-70s, as well as to her 588,000 followers on Weibo, a social-media
            platform. She notes that she left her family as a young child to enter
            intense sports training, and calls herself “extremely deprived of love”.
            She also describes herself as a “very bad woman” but insists that she
            never took money from Mr Zhang. Nor did she try to collect evidence of
            their liaison, she adds, though she recalls his paranoia about secret
            recording devices.


            Only a small minority of Chinese saw her essay, which was deleted within
            half an hour. Then censors moved to suppress discussion of it. Within
            the Great Firewall of censorship, online searches for Ms Peng or Mr Zhang
            pull up old news stories, with their comments functions disabled. It is
            difficult to estimate how many Chinese know of her allegations. It is
            clear that a large number do not.


            The fate of Ms Peng could yet become grimmer. Other women have been punished
            harshly for challenging much less powerful men. When #MeToo campaigns
            emerged in China in 2018, feminist groups at universities were closed
            down and activists detained. True, some academics accused of gross abuses
            were fired. Sexual harassment was added to the country’s civil code. But
            to preserve the party’s grip on power, several women who went public with
            complaints were also crushed. When Zhou Xiaoxuan, a former intern at China
            Central Television, the main state network, accused a star presenter of
            groping her, police in Beijing initially urged her to drop the complaints
            for the sake of society, and for that of her parents’ jobs in the public
            sector. In September Ms Zhou lost her suit against the presenter.


            Sporting fame has given Ms Peng’s case a double existence: censorship
            at home and intense attention overseas. After the Women’s Tennis Association
            ( WTA ), her sport’s America-based governing body, said it had tried and
            failed for days to reach her by telephone, text or web message, champions
            including Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka and Novak Djokovic expressed worry
            about her safety, as did several governments. In Beijing, the embassies
            of France and the European Union, among others, aired concerns.


            In a bid to kill the story overseas, Chinese media outlets took to platforms
            such as Twitter, which are blocked inside China. This has not gone well.
            International alarm was fuelled, not soothed, by an English-language tweet
            on November 18th from CGTN , China’s international television network.
            It claimed to show an email in which Ms Peng disowned her claims of sexual
            assault and said she was not missing, but “resting at home”. The editor
            of Global Times, a party tabloid that is a favoured outlet for exclusives
            from state-security services, tweeted in English that foreign media should
            stop speculating that Ms Peng is in danger for accusing Mr Zhang of, as
            he coyly put it, “the thing that people talked about”. His tabloid then
            tweeted what looked like staged videos of Ms Peng having dinner at a restaurant
            with her coach and meeting children at a tennis event.


            Double fault


            Ms Peng’s case is revealing. Protected by a monopoly at home, Chinese
            propagandists struggle in foreign markets which enjoy competition in ideas.
            They have become reliant on stoking nationalism among the Chinese public
            and blaming all ills on hostile foreign forces. This time, because Ms
            Peng cannot be spoken of at home, jingoistic reinforcements are not available.
            The strain showed on November 20th when a commentator for CGTN accused
            foreigners of racism for demanding evidence of Ms Peng’s safety. “Funny
            how some in the West feel people in China should be at their beck and
            call. Just another form of white male entitlement and privilege?” the
            commentator tweeted—a charge that might puzzle supporters like Ms Williams
            and Ms Osaka.


            China remains skilled at using market power to browbeat foreigners. On
            November 21st Ms Peng spoke by video to officials at the International
            Olympic Committee ( IOC ). Olympic bosses said that the tennis player
            seemed well, while failing to address the reason why she might not be
            well, namely her assault allegations against a former Chinese leader.
            With the Winter Olympics opening in Beijing in February, the IOC and corporate
            sponsors have multi-billion-dollar reasons to help China make the Peng
            Shuai story go away. Therein lies a bleak lesson. The WTA has been brave
            in challenging China, given that it has organised lucrative tournaments
            there. But as a women’s sports association, it depends on retaining the
            confidence of women players. Sometimes there are incentives larger than
            China’s market.


            The silencing of Ms Peng does not just expose the ruthless, self-serving
            nature of one-party rule. It shows how reliance on China saps the ability
            of outsiders to stand up for individual rights. There is no evidence that
            Ms Peng wrote her essay for foreign eyes. But thanks to Chinese censorship,
            foreigners have ended up as her only witnesses. The world will draw lessons
            about the true nature of the party from her fate.

        title: To prevent floods, China is building “sponge cities”
        text: 'L OCALS HAVE a saying: “When the Buddha’s feet are washed, Leshan cannot
            sleep.” The city in the south-western province of Sichuan has reason to
            be fearful. Leshan lies at the confluence of three tributaries of the
            Yangzi river. Centuries ago its residents carved a stone statue of the
            Buddha into a cliff face. It towers 70 metres high, overlooking the swift
            currents. In August 2020 its giant toes were bathed in river water for
            the first time since the Communist Party seized power in 1949. Thousands
            of residents suffered in the flood.

            But it is not only the ancient threat of rivers in spate that unnerves
            Leshan. It is also the way the city itself has grown. By the time of last
            year’s disaster, its built-up area, including satellite towns, was more
            than half as big again as it was in 2000. City planners had failed to
            make due provision for floodwater runoff.


            After four decades of frantic expansion, many other cities are in similar
            difficulty. They are poorly prepared for extreme downpours, which are
            likely to become more common as a result of global warming. One such storm
            in July over Zhengzhou, the capital of the central province of Henan,
            drenched the city in a year’s worth of rain in three days (see picture).
            Cars were swept away or trapped in flooded tunnels, where six motorists
            died. Another 14 people drowned in the subway system. In all, nearly 300
            were killed. According to Chinese researchers, average annual losses from
            floods in China doubled from around 100bn yuan ($15.6bn) in the decade
            after 2000 to over 200bn yuan in the early 2010s.


            About one in ten Chinese people lived in cities in 1950. Now six in ten
            do. About 70% of those cities are in floodplains. “We overbuilt, and we
            built it wrong,” says Yu Kongjian, a landscape architect at Peking University.
            Mr Yu was among the first to urge that urban areas become “sponge cities”,
            meaning they must be capable of absorbing rain without creating floods.
            He drew inspiration from old Chinese irrigation systems, such as “mulberry
            fish ponds” that act as natural reservoirs. He estimates that urbanisation
            has resulted in a third of farmers’ ponds and half of all wetlands disappearing.


            The government has embraced the idea, and has adopted the term sponge
            city. In 2015 it released a series of guidelines for building them. The
            aim is for 80% of cities to collect and recycle 70% of rainwater by 2030.
            Local authorities have set their own targets. In 2018 Zhengzhou announced
            a plan to ensure that nearly nine-tenths of its core urban area would
            be “spongified” by 2030. This year Leshan said 40% of its urban area would
            meet the government’s sponge-city standards by 2025.


            Cities have long tried to prevent flooding with hard engineering involving
            the “grey infrastructure” of dams, dykes and barriers. But urban surfaces
            of tarmac and concrete cause floodwater to rush into often inadequate
            drains. Producing a sponge effect requires measures such as creating artificial
            wetlands, planting roadside shrubs and using permeable materials to build
            pavements and plazas.


            The flooding in Zhengzhou shocked the country. It left many Chinese wondering
            whether sponge cities were all they were cracked up to be. After all,
            a lot of money has been flowing into spongification. Experts reckon that
            implementing the government’s sponge-city guidelines will cost at least
            $1trn nationwide. Generous subsidies have been dolloped out to localities.
            Netizens were up in arms when they discovered that Zhengzhou had planned
            to invest close to 55bn yuan in sponge-related projects in the two years
            preceding the floods. How much was actually spent has not been made public.
            But the work had clearly failed to avert disaster (and had not reversed
            the extensive building-over of Zhengzhou’s wetlands that had occurred
            in recent decades). Officials insisted that the downpour was a “once in
            a millennium” event that even the best-built sponge city could not have
            coped with perfectly.


            Experts agree that Zhengzhou has not disproved the effectiveness of the
            sponge-city programme. They point out that the government had required
            sponge projects to cover only 20% of the city’s urban area by 2020. So
            it may be difficult to evaluate Zhengzhou’s efforts at least until 2030.
            Kong Feng of the China Agricultural University in Beijing says that more
            subterranean spaces need to be used to collect floodwater. For example,
            he suggests, the lowest levels of underground car parks could be adapted
            to serve as emergency reservoirs. Such a backup “may not be needed for
            ten years. But use it just once and it will be life-saving for the city,”
            says Mr Kong. He has been involved in China’s first nationwide survey
            of risk from natural disasters, which was launched last year.


            It is the case that local governments sometimes misspend the money they
            are given for sponge-city building. They are often reluctant to use expensive
            land to create natural drainage systems such as parks and ponds. For a
            sponge city to work, many government units must collaborate, from water-conservation
            and weather bureaus to education and emergency departments. For two days
            before the worst of the flooding, Zhengzhou’s meteorological office issued
            its highest level of alert for a rainstorm. But few officials appeared
            to pay much attention.


            There is evidence from other places that spongifying can make a difference.
            Like Zhengzhou, the flood-prone city of Wuhan, on the banks of the Yangzi,
            was chosen as a pilot sponge-city in 2015. From July 5th to 6th last year,
            a cloudburst caused record rainfall over the city. Yet flood waters began
            to recede within hours. The following day centres for taking the gaokao,
            China’s university-entrance exam, stayed open despite heavy rain.


            Many critics overlook the fact that in Zhengzhou, too, water levels fell
            more swiftly than they would otherwise have done, says Mr Kong (it may
            have helped that Zhengzhou’s flood-prevention efforts had also included
            the building or refurbishing of over 5,000 kilometres of drains). City
            officials recently called on Mr Yu and his team to help them make Zhengzhou
            more absorbent.


            Tourists are flocking once again to Leshan’s Buddha, some to seek peace
            and protection at its feet. The statue conceals other strengths. Inside
            its body a drainage system, carved into the rock when it was built, helps
            to flush out rainwater and reduce erosion. Some say that the rocks gouged
            out of the cliff were dropped into the river, helping to calm it—and that
            the statue’s divine presence, where the rivers meet, also helps slow the
            water’s flow. For sponge-city enthusiasts it is nature, not the supernatural,
            that offers salvation. '

        title: Chinese officials help to cultivate a local graffiti scene
        text: 'I N THE MID -1990s outlines of bulbous heads, spray-painted with a
            single swipe, began to appear on Beijing’s walls. Next to them was written
            “ AK -47”. This tag, as graffitied signatures are known, belonged to Zhang
            Dali, an art student who had spent time in Italy and discovered graffiti
            culture there. On his return to China, swathes of its cities were being
            razed to make way for development. Workers were daubing the character
            chai, meaning “demolish”, on buildings due to be torn down. Mr Zhang took
            his cans to the same walls in protest at this often brutal upheaval.

            Mr Zhang is widely regarded as China’s first modern graffiti artist. More
            recent ones are influenced by skateboarding culture or rap music. The
            art form is still in its infancy in China—it is far less commonly seen
            than in the West. But Liu Yuansheng, co-author of “Beijing Graffiti”,
            published in 2020, reckons the number of practitioners in the capital
            has at times swelled to 200.


            Cities are riddled with CCTV cameras and teeming with law-enforcement
            officers. But it is not the threat of punishment that deters people from
            becoming graffiti artists. Doodlers rarely face more than a fine of 500
            yuan ($80) and a day in police custody. Those caught tagging often get
            away with a promise to paint over their work. Sometimes the public defends
            such art. Residents in the central city of Wuhan called on officers to
            remove advertisements that had been pasted over a work by Rui Huang, a
            local artist. They felt that the ads had defaced his graffiti.


            It may simply be that few people even consider spraying walls without
            permission. There is no tradition of guerrilla art used by criminal gangs
            to mark their territory or by protesters to attack the government. Mr
            Zhang’s poke at developers was a rare kind of dissent. The ruins gave
            him cover—officials turned a blind eye, knowing his works would soon be
            bulldozed.


            China does have a history of using walls to express dissent in written
            form, however. A famous example occurred during the Democracy Wall movement
            of 1978-79 when people flocked to the brick wall of a bus station in Beijing
            to put up “big-character posters” demanding greater political freedom.
            A constitutional right to put up such posters was scrapped in 1980. These
            days mural self-expression rarely goes beyond unauthorised “throwies”,
            or two-tone tags in bubble-like writing, which can be seen on walls in
            Beijing.


            Local governments sometimes even sponsor street art, regarding it as a
            sign of modernisation. In the run-up to the Olympic games that were held
            in Beijing in 2008, officials in the capital encouraged artists to paint
            a 300-metre-long “graffiti wall”. Designs were vetted first. A street
            in the south-western city of Chongqing is home to one of the world’s largest
            graffiti projects (pictured). It was created, with official approval,
            by 800 painters. This year Wuhan paid local crews to draw graffiti on
            a tram and several public buses.


            There are others, however, who barely qualify as artists who scribble
            on walls. A Chinese citizen in Sydney, who goes by the name Lil Quacky,
            collects graffiti in an Instagram account called “chinesegraffitihub”
            (the app is blocked in China). Quacky began the project last year after
            noticing that someone had rewritten a roadside slogan in China that had
            urged people to carry away their rubbish. It had been changed to “Carry
            away your love.” Most graffiti submitted to Quacky consists of untidy
            spray-painted sentences. “Are they enough to shock passers-by, to make
            them think, to make them stay for a while?” are Quacky’s criteria for
            posting them online. Hundreds of examples have passed the test. '

        title: Talks between Xi Jinping and Joe Biden do not herald a thaw
        text: 'B EIJING BASKED in golden sunshine on November 16th as President Xi
            Jinping spent more than three hours on a video call with his American
            counterpart, Joe Biden. After months of tensions, the virtual meeting
            was supposed to show that their countries could manage disputes and avoid
            a spiral of confrontation.

            The two leaders’ remarks matched the burst of mild weather. Mr Xi called
            Mr Biden an “old friend”, nodding to hours that the two men had spent
            travelling and talking together in 2011, when each held the rank of vice-president.
            “I stand ready to work with you, Mr President, to build consensus, take
            active steps and move China- US relations forward in a positive direction,”
            Mr Xi said.


            China’s state media announced, approvingly, that Mr Biden had offered
            reassurances on the most neuralgic points in the bilateral relationship.
            Notably, he had restated America’s long-standing position that it does
            not support independence for the island of Taiwan, which China claims
            as its own. According to the Chinese readout, Mr Biden also hailed China’s
            5,000 years of history, declared that his administration does not seek
            to change China’s system of government and stressed that as America strengthens
            its global alliances, the aim is not to oppose China. After months in
            which Chinese censors have tolerated online mockery of Mr Biden as a doddery
            shui wang, or “sleep king”, prone to napping during meetings, official
            outlets carried side-by-side images of Mr Biden and Mr Xi beaming and
            waving at one another online.


            The White House, for its part, described a businesslike meeting. It quoted
            Mr Biden as telling his counterpart: “Our responsibility as leaders of
            China and the United States is to ensure that the competition between
            our countries does not veer into conflict, whether intended or unintended.”
            American officials are conscious that political opponents at home are
            eager to accuse Mr Biden of appeasement or of entering endless talks that
            go nowhere. The national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, duly described
            Mr Biden confronting Mr Xi over human rights, unfair trade practices and
            bullying of Taiwan. Mr Biden urged Mr Xi to send “senior and empowered”
            officials to meetings to make progress on pressing issues, rather than
            pursue “dialogue for dialogue’s sake”, Mr Sullivan told a post-meeting
            briefing at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Suitable topics include
            Afghanistan, trade, climate change, energy security, public health and
            the nuclear programmes of North Korea and Iran, Mr Biden suggested.


            The video call was a far cry from a traditional summit between American
            and Chinese leaders. Such events are preceded by months of wrangling by
            officials over concessions, promises and deals so sensitive that only
            the top leaders can make them. It says much about the dire state of relations
            that this conclusion-free meeting—held online because Mr Xi has not left
            China or met a foreign leader since the covid-19 pandemic began—counts
            as a modest breakthrough.


            In early September Mr Xi was shockingly testy at the start of a telephone
            call with Mr Biden, say people briefed on its contents. In that conversation,
            Mr Xi essentially rehearsed, in private, the same argument levelled by
            officials in public, namely that America is bent on containing China’s
            rise and is to blame for all present-day tensions. The argument’s second
            part is that President Donald Trump was a bad leader, but that Mr Biden
            is the same or worse because—as a more rational politician—he should know
            better. More emollient signals were sent by China on October 6th when
            Mr Sullivan met Mr Xi’s most senior foreign-policy aide, Yang Jiechi,
            in Switzerland. Western and Chinese sources describe Mr Yang explaining
            that China seeks a calm external environment in 2022, to avoid disrupting
            events including the Beijing Winter Olympics in February and a year-end
            Communist Party congress at which Mr Xi is expected to launch a third
            term as party chief.


            In this low-trust moment, Mr Biden and Mr Xi are arguably the only American
            and Chinese officials able to have substantive discussions. Their video
            chat was better than nothing, but worryingly limited. When it comes to
            co-existing sustainably, the two sides are far apart. Mr Biden says that
            America and China are locked in an intense competition, which must be
            managed responsibly. Chinese officials call that framing too negative.
            They prefer talk of relations based on mutual respect and mutual interests:
            code for a realist America realising it has no choice but to accommodate
            China’s autocratic, statist ways.


            China’s plan for world peace: America stops defying China


            Mr Biden is presented in China as a more pragmatic president than his
            predecessor. Alas, scholars and state media frame his willingness to talk
            as an admission of American failure. In China’s telling, American inflation
            is linked to Trump-imposed trade tariffs (though inflation is recent and
            tariffs have been in place for three years). Chinese analysts blame another
            complex problem, supply-chain chaos, on a simple cause: Trump-era attempts
            to block exports of semiconductors and other advanced technology to China,
            while urging firms to move factories out of China. With the American economy
            now in “bleak” shape, the Biden administration “needs to ease relations
            with China in order to improve its political standing at home”, says Wang
            Yong, director of Peking University’s American studies centre. Professor
            Wang adds that America is losing the hearts and minds of younger Chinese,
            who have “given up their illusions” that the West is sincere when it expresses
            concerns about Muslims in Xinjiang or democrats in Hong Kong.


            China’s leaders still want investment and technology from the West, but
            they think it is in decadent decline and are decoupling from Western norms
            and ideas. One video call cannot begin to fix a relationship in crisis.
            Mid-November often brings spells of sunshine to Beijing, which do not
            last. In China’s ancient, 12-season calendar, the freezing periods called
            “small snow” and “big snow” are next. Relations with America face a similar
            ice age.

        title: China will stick to a zero-covid policy, for now
        text: 'N EARLY TWO years into the covid-19 pandemic, China’s propaganda machine
            is locked in a futile argument with the outside world. The row is about
            whether this giant country is paying too high a price for its “zero-covid”
            policy. China’s attempts to eliminate the virus, rather than merely manage
            it, are certainly costly. They have largely closed China’s borders for
            19 months. Dozens of city districts, towns and counties are enduring lockdowns
            as the highly contagious Delta variant and an early cold snap cause a
            flare-up of infections. There are several hundred cases of the disease
            nationwide. Many of them are local transmissions rather than imports from
            abroad, underscoring Delta’s perils. Controls include roadblocks manned
            by police in protective suits, closed schools, cancelled trains and testing
            of millions of residents.

            With officials facing punishment for cases on their watch, grassroots
            harshness abounds. The northern city of Heihe has declared a “people’s
            war”, with rewards of up to 100,000 yuan ($15,600) for residents who report
            such pandemic crimes as illegal hunting. A county in Inner Mongolia locked
            nearly 10,000 tourists in hotels for two weeks to smother an outbreak.
            Two pharmacies in suburban Beijing lost their licences for selling fever-reducing
            medicines to a couple without logging their names in a virus-tracking
            database. The customers, who had earlier visited areas with covid cases
            and later tested positive, are being prosecuted for failing to report
            to a fever clinic. Citing possible transmission risks, officials in cities
            including Chengdu, Harbin and Wuxi entered the homes of quarantined locals
            and killed their pet cats.


            Officials reject foreign reports that call such measures unsustainable.
            “It’s simply not right to question China’s efforts to eliminate the virus,”
            complained Xinhua, a state news agency, citing the country’s “robust”
            economy and calling travel curbs a “minor inconvenience”. Hu Xijin, the
            editor of a tabloid newspaper, says foreigners are jealous of China’s
            virus-fighting record, and charges that America has eased pandemic controls
            because it values “money over life”. In fact, the two sides are talking
            past one another if they focus on how strict zero-covid policies are.
            It is more relevant to ask who feels the pain from those controls. They
            are best understood as a giant utilitarian experiment. To help the majority
            enjoy an orderly, covid-free existence, a hapless minority—notably those
            who catch the virus or are suspected of contact with carriers—must sacrifice
            individual liberties, privacy and dignity.


            A focus on the interests of the majority resonates with many Chinese.
            They remember images of chaos in Wuhan last year, as the virus overwhelmed
            hospitals in that city of 10m. They know that the health system is weaker
            outside big urban centres. Many doctors in rural clinics lack university
            degrees. Intensive-care beds are rare. American-style pandemic policies
            could have led to millions of deaths. As for closed borders, which cause
            anguish to expatriates and Chinese with family overseas, they do not greatly
            pain the 87% of the population without passports.


            Many citizens of democratic countries would not tolerate half the rules
            imposed on China in this pandemic. But the collective sacrifices of the
            Chinese have produced something remarkable. In a country of 1.4bn people,
            the official total death toll from the pandemic is under 6,000, compared
            with almost 808,000 excess deaths in America, which has less than one-quarter
            of China’s population. Some scepticism of China’s statistics is reasonable,
            given that officials in Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected,
            concealed the virus for weeks in late 2019 and early 2020. Yet if large
            outbreaks were still being concealed today, control systems would start
            breaking down, for they rely on tracking and tracing fresh cases. Instead,
            life in much of China is relatively normal.


            Strictness for the greater good continues to enjoy unmistakable public
            support. But Chinese leaders do face a risk whenever public opinion suspects
            that overly harsh lockdowns actually serve the interests of a minority,
            ie, officials eager to cover their backs. There are signs of disquiet.
            Chengdu, for instance, recently broadened its pandemic controls, testing
            82,000 people whose mobile telephones had spent ten minutes within 800
            metres of a suspected case. Other cities have started copying this approach.
            But on November 8th two leading epidemiologists and a doctor in Chengdu
            wrote an open letter warning pandemic officials that such mass testing
            must be guided by science, and risks causing panic. That officials keep
            talking about punishing rule-breakers is a sign of at least some public
            fatigue. It also risks driving the weary to hide from the authorities.


            The party calls pandemic control proof that it loves the people


            To maintain support, strict controls must be seen to benefit everyone,
            though a minority will feel the most hardship. Foreigners in China, yearning
            for borders to open, often suggest that the sight of normality in the
            rest of the world will soon make Chinese citizens restless. For now, state
            media keep such envy at bay by presenting the West as a death-stalked
            hellhole. An online video promoted this week by state media is filled
            with images of Donald Trump when he was America’s president, and the chaos
            abroad of those days. It calls American travellers “walking vectors of
            contagion”.


            To date, zero-covid’s worst effects have been felt by luckless minorities,
            from locked-down residents to those whose livelihoods depend on free movement
            within and outside China. Fear, and the stigma endured by those who catch
            the virus, have ensured compliance with orders. Harsh policies have bought
            China’s leaders time, as they wait for potent vaccines and antiviral drugs
            that might let them open up safely. Officials have arguably slowed an
            exit by refusing to approve foreign vaccines that are more effective than
            China’s, in their eagerness to prove the superiority of one-party rule
            over Western democracy. Further mutations of the virus may one day challenge
            China’s strategy. If they make lockdowns more frequent, the ranks of the
            unlucky will grow.

        title: China still steals commercial secrets for its own firms’ profit
        text: 'E ARLIER THIS year Microsoft found that a group of hackers, which it
            called Hafnium, had broken into hundreds of thousands of computer servers
            around the world that were running the firm’s mail and calendar software.
            The cyber-thieves were stealing emails, documents and other data from
            small businesses, NGO s and local governments in an enormous, seemingly
            indiscriminate, cyber-attack. In July America, Britain, other members
            of NATO and the European Union all blamed China. America was more specific.
            It named China’s civilian intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security
            ( MSS ).

            Such co-ordinated condemnation of the Chinese government for allegedly
            hacking into foreign computer systems was unprecedented. But it was no
            surprise in the West that China appeared to be responsible (as always
            in such cases, it denied involvement).


            In 2015, standing next to Xi Jinping at the White House, Barack Obama
            said the two presidents had agreed that neither country would “conduct
            or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property” for
            commercial gain. But cyber-experts say China remains hard at it. In September
            attacks allegedly mounted by the Chinese government included ones against
            Indian media firms, Microsoft’s Windows operating system and Roshan, a
            telecoms network in Afghanistan.


            Spy agencies everywhere hack into other countries’ computer systems. What
            irks Western governments is that China also steals commercial secrets
            to pass on to its companies, whereas there is no evidence that the West’s
            spies collude with business like this. Since Mr Xi took power in 2012,
            China’s hacking capabilities have grown.


            The Chinese army’s signals-intelligence wing, the Third Department, used
            to be in charge of such work. It attacked everyone from American military
            contractors to Google. In 2014 America’s Department of Justice formally
            accused five Chinese citizens from the Third Department’s Unit 61398 of
            “computer hacking, economic espionage and other offences” against American
            companies involved in nuclear and solar power as well as metal production.
            (Those charged were believed to be in China and have not appeared in court.)
            By then, however, control over hacking activities was being transferred
            to the MSS . The army is still hacking, but its targets are now mainly
            government ones.


            The MSS was first publicly linked to the hacking of foreign companies
            in 2017. Its involvement was exposed by an anonymous blog called Intrusion
            Truth, which monitors such attacks. Several cyber-security firms endorsed
            its analysis. Later that year the American government charged three alleged
            MSS hackers in absentia for attacks on foreign firms. Two of the accused
            had been identified by the blog.


            Attributing cyber-attacks to China, let alone to specific government agencies,
            is tricky. Benjamin Read of Mandiant, an American firm that tries to keep
            tabs on who is hacking what, explains that he and his colleagues gather
            and analyse telltale tracks, such as the addresses of computers used to
            launch attacks. A single hacking incident usually does not leave enough
            information to identify the culprit: attackers can give their computers
            a false address. But that can be laborious, since, whenever they use a
            new address, the hackers must also reinstall all of the tools they use
            to carry out attacks. This creates an incentive to use addresses repeatedly,
            which facilitates the work of cyber-detectives.


            Under military oversight, China’s cyber-attacks often seemed haphazard.
            Hackers were given lists of targets at the beginning of each month, but
            there appeared to be little supervision or co-ordination of their efforts.
            The MSS has integrated the process more closely with other intelligence-gathering
            operations, says Mr Read. One team might grab a target’s mobile-phone
            data from a telecoms firm, then hand the information to a different group
            that would use it to infiltrate the device.


            Computer experts at Chinese universities have long co-operated with cyber-theft
            operations conducted by the army and the MSS. Such people have been obvious
            targets for recruitment by China’s intelligence agencies as in-house talent.
            Now the government is expanding the potential supply of hackers by creating
            a vast new teaching and research facility in the central city of Wuhan,
            says Dakota Cary of the Centre for Security and Emerging Technologies
            at Georgetown University in Washington. The 40-square-kilometre campus,
            called the National Cybersecurity Centre, is under the direction of the
            Communist Party’s Cyberspace Affairs Commission, led by Mr Xi. The centre
            will produce its first graduates—1,300 of them—next year.


            Growing numbers of people are needed to sift through the huge volumes
            of data that are stolen by the hackers. Mr Brazil of BluePath Labs reckons
            there are probably several hundred thousand analysts working on this already.
            “The economy and military have greatly benefited from technology theft,”
            he says. “Why stop just because those foreigners are feeling aggrieved?”


            America’s Federal Bureau of Investigation has been stepping up its efforts
            to curb the espionage. On November 5th an MSS officer was convicted in
            Ohio of conspiring to steal jet-engine technology from General Electric,
            an American conglomerate. In July two MSS spies living in China were formally
            accused of hacking into high-tech businesses around the world over the
            course of many years, most recently to steal pharmaceutical data related
            to covid-19 vaccines and treatments.


            Companies that worry about China’s hacking often use a private cyber-security
            firm to monitor their networks for subtle patterns indicating an attack,
            and try to cut it off before it goes too far. Encrypting as much data
            as possible helps them to minimise their losses. But it is extremely hard
            to fend off all cyber-spying. If China’s hackers really want to break
            into a network, are willing to work slowly and are able to operate stealthily,
            they will often succeed. The entreaties of Western governments will not
            deter them. '

        title: Behind bars, Hong Kong’s democrats remain popular
        text: 'S OME NEW inmates in Hong Kong’s prisons have reading wishlists that
            reflect interests beyond such common behind-bars topics as self-improvement
            and how to exercise in small spaces. Their requests include dystopian
            novels about totalitarianism, such as George Orwell’s “1984” and “Brave

            Such bookworms belong to a new breed of prisoner: the dissident. Before
            the pro-democracy demonstrations that roiled Hong Kong for much of 2019,
            few people were incarcerated for taking part in political protests. But
            the authorities have got tougher. More than 10,000 people have been arrested
            in connection with the unrest. Court proceedings have begun against a
            quarter of them. The government is building a megacourt to process a backlog
            of cases, including some involving a national-security law that was imposed
            in Hong Kong last year. Hundreds of people are now serving prison sentences
            or being held on remand for alleged offences related to the protests.
            Many Hong Kongers know someone in jail who has been accused of such crimes.


            Conditions are better than in the mainland’s jails, where political prisoners
            are allowed little, if any, contact with the outside world and are often
            treated brutally. In Hong Kong, volunteers collect books and organise
            letter-writing campaigns for detainees. Online guides provide advice to
            correspondents about what not to write: avoid slogans from the protests
            and any references to violence or sexually explicit material. Instead,
            write about trivial news, tell jokes, describe movie plots and draw sketches,
            suggests one manual. A bookseller recently ran an eight-part workshop.
            Participants wrote letters to inmates and read prison literature by Nelson
            Mandela, Havel and activists from Hong Kong. Joshua Wong (pictured, entering
            prison), one of the best-known faces of the pro-democracy movement, has
            written that he is grateful for “every word and every sentence” mailed
            to him.


            Sympathy for political detainees is widespread in Hong Kong. During a
            heatwave in May, a petition for the provision of cold water and more showers
            to those incarcerated garnered over 140,000 signatures. A cottage industry
            has emerged to help them in other ways. Some Hong Kongers transcribe popular
            YouTube videos for inmates, who cannot access the internet. Other pen-pals
            copy and paste posts from LIHKG , an online forum that attracts democracy
            enthusiasts, in order to create a physical newspaper for inmates. “As
            an avid user of LIHKG , these forum-post printouts are my Bible,” says
            a detainee quoted by a prisoner-rights group.


            Well-known pro-democracy inmates pass the time by exercising, writing
            letters, helping fellow inmates with their appeals and publishing articles
            in local newspapers. Chow Hang Tung, a jailed barrister and human-rights
            activist, accepted her boyfriend’s proposal of marriage, which was sent
            to her by letter. It was later published in Ming Pao, one of Hong Kong’s
            leading newspapers. These young Hong Kongers are “learning to seek freedom
            in an environment where they have lost their freedom”, writes Chan Kin-man,
            an academic who served 16 months in jail for his role in the Umbrella
            Movement of 2014.


            Imprisoned activists are scattered throughout the city’s jails to prevent
            them from communicating with each other. But officials still worry about
            their influence. In September an elite squad was used to quell a protest
            by 18 prisoners angered at the treatment of other inmates, including Tiffany
            Yuen, a district councillor who is on remand under the national-security
            law. They had been accused of acquiring a prohibited number of chocolates
            and hair clips. Bizarrely, officials feared they might give them to other
            inmates to win support for Ms Yuen. “This is how groups begin, like terrorist
            groups recruiting followers,” said Woo Ying-ming, the head of Hong Kong’s
            prisons. Even behind bars, officials keep Ms Yuen’s type under close watch.

        title: Xi Jinping is rewriting history to justify his rule for years to come
        text: 'I N PREPARATION FOR a third five-year term as the Communist Party’s
            leader, Xi Jinping has been changing the rules of politics, business and
            society. He has also been pursuing another project that he sees as essential
            to his continued grip on power: rewriting the history of the party itself.
            Mr Xi wants to show his country that he is indispensable, a political
            giant on a par with Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping who is turning China
            into a global power by building on their legacy.

            On November 8th about 370 members of the political and military elite
            will gather in Beijing for an annual four-day meeting of the party’s Central
            Committee. The only advertised topic on their agenda is a resolution on
            the party’s history. It will be the third in the party’s 100-year existence.
            The first, in 1945, and the second, in 1981, were triumphs for Mao and
            Deng respectively, consolidating their grip on power at crucial junctures.
            Mr Xi’s ability to secure one of his own suggests that he has quelled
            any meaningful opposition to extending his rule at a party congress that
            is due to be held late in 2022. The resolution will be “an extraordinary
            demonstration of power”, says Jude Blanchette of the Centre for Strategic
            and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington.


            The plenum is the second-to-last conclave of the Central Committee before
            the five-yearly congress, and a crucial one for setting its tone. Next
            year’s event will mark a decade of Mr Xi’s leadership. By loosely established
            convention, it would be his political farewell. But he is all but certain
            to secure another term. In the past year, once again, he has been working
            hard to silence critics and crush potential rivals, purging the security
            apparatus, promoting political allies and showing the party’s muscle by
            unleashing regulators on big private firms. Before the congress he will
            probably make his choice (in secret) of replacements for senior officials
            who are expected to retire at a meeting of the national legislature in
            March 2023. They include a new prime minister and domestic-security chief.


            The resolution on history has been circulated among senior officials,
            but its contents will not be made public until after the plenum ends on
            November 11th. Speeches by Mr Xi and the writings of official commentators
            offer clues. It is expected to celebrate the party’s achievements, minimise
            the horrors unleashed by Mao and suggest that Mao, Deng and Mr Xi have
            shared the same vision. The reigns of Mao and Deng will be presented as
            essential preliminary phases before the start of Mr Xi’s “new era”. Mao
            helped the Chinese people “stand up” after a century of humiliation by
            foreign powers. Deng set China on a path to “get rich” after centuries
            of poverty. Now Mr Xi is helping China to “get strong”. The resolution
            will hail Mr Xi’s judicious leadership in managing social, economic and
            national-security challenges, and suggest a continuing need for his wisdom.


            Mr Xi’s predecessors used history differently in their resolutions. In
            1945 Mao justified a purge of his enemies, blaming them for past mistakes
            so he could position himself as the unquestioned leader. In 1981 Deng’s
            resolution said that Mao had made serious mistakes and that the Cultural
            Revolution of 1966-76 had been a “grave blunder”, causing chaos. By criticising
            Mao, albeit cautiously, Deng rebuilt public support for the party and
            freed his hand to pursue free-market reforms.


            But history presents a different challenge to Mr Xi. On the party’s left
            wing are neo-Maoists who have long agitated for a restoration of their
            hero, and have criticised Deng, whom they blame for such problems as corruption
            and inequality. On the right are those who worry (very privately) that
            China is sliding back towards a Mao-style dictatorship and losing its
            commitment to Deng’s reforms.


            Mr Xi has declared that neither Mao nor Deng should be used to “negate”
            the other. He does not want a history filled with mistakes and contradictions,
            nor one that raises questions about one-man rule. He believes the collapse
            of the Soviet Union was hastened by a failure to protect the legacies
            of Lenin and Stalin. He has campaigned vigorously against “historical
            nihilism”—essentially anything that casts the party’s past in an unfavourable
            light. Tomes that excavate Mao’s worst mistakes, once tolerated, are now
            strongly discouraged.


            A new official history of the party, published in February, gives a glimpse
            of Mr Xi’s preferred approach. It touches only briefly on the Cultural
            Revolution. It does not mention the famine caused by the Great Leap Forward
            that killed tens of millions, nor any casualties in the crushing of the
            pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square in 1989. The section on Mr
            Xi’s tenure takes up more than a quarter of the book. Mr Xi’s predecessors,
            Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, are given much less space.


            The new resolution will suggest that China needs Mr Xi in order to fulfil
            long-term goals such as turning the country into a “modern socialist nation”
            by 2035 and a “prosperous” and “strong” one by 2049, the 100th anniversary
            of the People’s Republic. It will probably mention his “common prosperity”
            campaign to reduce inequality and his “dual circulation” strategy to make
            the economy more resilient to external shocks like the pandemic and trade
            disputes with America. It is expected to describe a grim international
            environment, though America and its allies may not be named. And it will
            probably repeat the party’s ritual language about Taiwan, saying it must
            be reunited with the mainland. China’s failure to retake Taiwan has been
            a sore point for every leader since Mao. The resolution is sure to mention
            Mr Xi’s call for the “great revival of the Chinese nation” by 2049, which
            suggests that he aims to secure reunification before then. A specific
            promise is unlikely.


            In anticipation of the plenum, the propaganda apparatus has begun cranking
            out fawning articles about Mr Xi’s wisdom, hoping, it would seem, to foster
            enthusiasm for the idea that he will carry on ruling. On November 1st
            People’s Daily, the party’s mouthpiece, began publishing a series of editorials
            under the title “Crucial decisions in the new era”. They hail the party’s
            achievements since it was founded in 1921, and praise Mr Xi’s contributions
            to them. From Mr Xi’s perspective, the resolution “not only has to look
            back over the past, but it has to look to the future”, says Joseph Fewsmith
            of Boston University. And according to Mr Fewsmith, Mr Xi thinks, “The
            future, c’est moi.”'

            WHEN AMERICA and the Soviet Union raced each other to build ever-larger
            nuclear arsenals during the cold war, China ambled disdainfully. It did
            not detonate its first nuclear weapon until 1964, kept only a few hundred
            warheads compared with the tens of thousands piled up by the superpowers,
            and to this day maintains it will never be the first to use nukes in a
            war. Now China is sprinting to catch up.


            In its latest annual assessment, the Pentagon says China’s stockpile of
            nuclear warheads, which last year it reckoned to be in the “low-200s”,
            could triple to about 700 by 2027 and will probably quintuple to about
            1,000 or more by 2030. That is sharply higher than America’s previous
            forecast that the arsenal would double in size by then. Even so, it would
            still be smaller than America’s or Russia’s. Those countries each have
            about 4,000 warheads.


            The report’s conclusions explain America’s alarm about China’s rapid military
            modernisation. Hitherto the greatest worry has been about its conventional
            arms, notably its growing ability to overwhelm and invade Taiwan, and
            stop America from coming to the rescue. Now the anxiety is spreading to
            the nuclear domain.


            Speculation about the build-up mounted in June and July, when researchers
            spotted that China was building hundreds of missile silos in Gansu, a
            western province, and in Xinjiang, its neighbour. Then the generals were
            stunned by China’s testing of a new weapon—a hypersonic glide vehicle
            mounted on a large rocket—that could deliver a nuclear warhead at high
            speed while evading anti-missile defences. The chairman of the joint chiefs
            of staff, General Mark Milley, said it was close to being a “Sputnik moment”—the
            shock America felt when the Soviet Union sent the first satellite into
            orbit in 1957.


            The Pentagon believes China is building fast-breeder reactors to make
            the necessary plutonium; may already have created a full “triad”, ie,
            the ability to launch nuclear weapons from the land, sea and air; and
            is expanding its early-warning systems, with help from Russia.


            All told, China is shifting to a “launch on warning” doctrine. Rather
            than rely on a minimal nuclear deterrent to retaliate after an initial
            nuclear attack, China would henceforth fire at the first sign of an incoming
            nuclear strike, even before the enemy warheads have landed. This posture
            is akin to that of America and Russia, notes James Acton of the Carnegie
            Endowment, a think-tank in Washington, “but increases the risk of inadvertent
            launch, such as a response to a false warning”.


            Some Chinese strategists have debated moving to “mutual assured destruction”—the
            doctrine that animated both superpowers in the cold war—and even discussed
            when it would make sense to be first to use nuclear weapons. They have
            also considered low-yield weapons that could be used in a limited manner,
            without initiating all-out nuclear war.


            The nuclear expansion casts a new light on China’s island-building in
            the South China Sea, where it has constructed military bases on disputed
            reefs and atolls. Its current submarine-launched missiles need to sail
            far into the Pacific if the JL-2 missiles they carry are to reach the
            east coast of the United States. But the JL-3 missiles in development,
            intended for a new generation of “boomer” submarines, could fire from
            waters close to China. That would encourage China to create maritime “bastions”
            in the Gulf of Bohai and the South China Sea, modelled on those the Soviet
            Union established in the Barents Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk, whose waters
            were thickly defended by submarines, surface ships and aircraft.


            Why is China building up its nukes at a time when America and Russia have
            extended the New START treaty, which limits their arsenals, and when America
            is thinking of reducing the role of nuclear weapons by declaring that
            their “sole purpose” is to deter or retaliate against nuclear attack?


            One reason is China’s worry that its arsenal is too small to survive an
            American first strike. Many could be destroyed by nuclear weapons or accurate
            conventional missiles; remaining ones might then be taken out by America’s
            anti-missile systems.


            China is modernising its land-based missiles by building mobile launchers
            with solid-fuel rockets, which are easier to hide and quicker to fire
            than older models. It is also working on its triad. As well deploying
            more nuclear submarines with ballistic missiles, China has brought into
            service the H6-N bomber, which can carry an air-launched ballistic missile.
            And it has also deployed an earlier version of a hypersonic weapon, the
            DF-17 (pictured).


            Xi Jinping, China’s leader, wants to build a “world-class” military force
            by 2049, the centenary of the Communist Party’s takeover, as part of the
            “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”. A powerful nation, it seems,
            must have powerful nuclear forces—especially if it is going to stand up
            to America.


            As though China’s nuclear build-up were not enough to worry about, this
            year’s Pentagon report says that China’s work on “dual-use applications”
            call into question its compliance with the Biological and Toxins Weapons
            Convention. Moreover, it says America “cannot certify” that China is meeting
            its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention.


            All this can only feed America’s anxiety about the rise of China, and
            reinforce the sense that it is in a new cold war. It also increases the
            risk of errors, or of an incident turning into a large confrontation—say,
            over America’s “freedom of navigation” patrols in the South China Sea.
            Perhaps most worrying is that China has thus far eschewed nuclear arms-control
            deals, and has shown little interest in hotlines and other risk-reduction
            mechanisms that helped to manage the contest between America and the Soviet
            Union.


            Tellingly, the Pentagon report confirms the purpose of a telephone call
            that senior American defence officials and General Milley made to the
            PLA in October 2020 to reassure the Chinese that America was not about
            to attack them. As the report puts it, “these events highlighted the potential
            for misunderstanding and miscalculation.”'

        title: A row about toilets reveals a lot about women’s place in China

            THE #MeToo movement struggles in China. On November 2nd, Peng Shuai, a
            Chinese tennis star, publicly accused Zhang Gaoli, a former deputy prime
            minister who retired in 2018, of sexual assault. It is the most high-profile
            #MeToo allegation made in China since the campaign took off globally in
            2018, and the first time a senior Communist Party official has been implicated.
            There has been no official response to Ms Peng’s post, but censors swiftly
            removed it from Chinese social-media sites and blocked online discussion
            of it and the #MeToo hashtag.


            This is par for the course. The country’s media are not allowed to report
            #MeToo. But the grievances that fuelled the movement abroad have bubbled
            up in China. A growing number of women are suing powerful men for sexual
            assault. #MeToo has fuelled an “unprecedented interest” in women’s rights,
            says Lu Pin, a Chinese feminist who went into self-exile in America in
            2015.


            Whatever good feminist campaigns have done in China, they have often been
            bad for the campaigners. In 2012 a group of feminists protested against
            a shortage of public toilets for women by using men’s lavatories instead
            (see picture). State-security police responded by harassing and threatening
            them. But the government took up their cause. Cities started building
            more toilets for women. Last year, at the UN, China cited this as a big
            achievement of its efforts in the past five years to improve the lot of
            women. It did not mention the people who had pushed for such change.


            Most of the toilet-reform activists have been forced to give up their
            campaigning. Some are subject to intense surveillance by the state. Several
            have become fitness fanatics, going to gyms to run and lift weights. “Many
            of us suffer from depression and anxiety,” says one. “Exercise is a way
            for us to prepare for whatever comes next, good or bad.”


            Officials are making some effort to show they care. In 2019 China’s highest
            court added sexual harassment as grounds for filing a lawsuit. The Ministry
            of Education now works with universities and schools to curb it on campuses.
            An anti-sexual-harassment clause was included in China’s first civil code,
            which took effect this year. Darius Longarino of Yale Law School says
            the Communist Party often represses activists while trying to show that
            it is fixing the problems they raise.


            But the party has used its control of the media and internet to turn #MeToo-related
            debate into something more suited to its own needs. Censors have suppressed
            use of the #MeToo hashtag and its Chinese equivalent, but have allowed
            selective discussion of a handful of cases that reflect badly on people
            or institutions that are in the party’s sights.


            The entertainment industry and its celebrities are among the party’s targets.
            It fears that they are undermining moral rectitude in China by mimicking
            the worst excesses of Hollywood. In August police arrested Kris Wu, a
            pop star, after he was accused by a university student of pressing women
            to have sex with him. The government banned many online groups that drooled
            over him and other male celebrities. Some of these also happened to be
            forums for debate about women’s rights.


            This year state media have also highlighted an alleged sexual crime involving
            a manager of Alibaba, a technology giant. The man was accused by a female
            employee of forcing her, while on a business trip, to drink until she
            blacked out, and then of raping her. The company fired the man, who then
            was cleared by police of any crime. The scandal happened to coincide with
            a sweeping regulatory clampdown on Alibaba and other large non-state tech
            companies, seemingly motivated in part by the party’s desire to curtail
            their enormous economic clout.


            Despite its efforts to appear woke, the party is reluctant to up-end a
            patriarchal social order in which women are routinely treated as sex objects,
            subservient to men. The legal system still favours harassers. The burden
            of proof is very high for women who make accusations of sexual assault.
            An analysis of civil cases between 2018 and 2020 by scholars at Yale Law
            School found that more than 90% of those involving sexual harassment had
            been brought by alleged perpetrators against their accusers (for slandering
            them) or their employers (for disciplining them).


            In September a court in Beijing rejected a woman’s petition for redress,
            which had become the country’s most famous case relating to sexual harassment.
            The plaintiff had accused a well-known television anchor of groping and
            forcibly kissing her when she was an intern. The judge said she had insufficient
            evidence. The plaintiff, known as Xianzi, plans to appeal. The verdict,
            she says, has made it “very easy for the public to assume I was lying”.


            In contrast to the case involving Alibaba’s employee, journalists at state
            media were banned from reporting on Xianzi’s plea. In the week leading
            up to the verdict, anyone who posted information about the case had their
            social-media accounts frozen. Xianzi’s own such accounts were partially
            or fully blocked.


            Such experiences are common among outspoken feminists in China. By shutting
            them out of social media, while tolerating the rantings of their critics,
            censors fan the flames of bigotry. Women who try to share their experiences
            of being sexually harassed in the office or being required to drink large
            quantities of alcohol at work banquets, are often “slut-shamed or labelled
            as anti-government or as hostile foreign forces”, says Xianzi.


            Anti-feminist sentiment is fuelled by the party’s conservatism. Xi Jinping
            tries to project an aura of masculinity (his attacks on showbiz have also
            included a ban on effeminate men appearing on television). He is fawningly
            known in China as “Xi Dada”, literally meaning “Uncle Xi”. He promotes
            traditional Confucian values, which emphasise the role of women as obedient
            wives and mothers.


            Online trolls who attack #MeToo use the same authoritarian, jingoistic
            language that the party delights in, notes Ms Lu, the feminist in America.
            They also engage in a kind of grassroots activism, with their numerous
            social-media accounts and independent websites that spice up the party’s
            message with extra dashes of anti-liberal vitriol. That is the only sort
            of advocacy allowed. '

        title: China’s state-controlled media are put on an even shorter leash
        text: 'T HE COMMUNIST PARTY’S leadership, with “Comrade Xi Jinping at the
            core”, attaches “great importance” to managing internet content. So declared
            the government on October 20th when unveiling new instructions about what
            news could be republished online. This was an understatement. Under the
            party’s rule, China’s press has never enjoyed more than a small modicum
            of freedom. Mr Xi has relentlessly tightened controls. Reporters and editors
            deemed politically wayward have been disciplined, fired or jailed.

            The new directive, issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China (
            CAC ), updates a list, first published in 2016, of news sources that other
            websites may republish. CAC said the revision was aimed at “resolutely
            closing the ‘back door’ on illegal newsgathering and redistribution”.


            The list names 1,358 approved outlets. That is nearly four times as many
            as were named in the previous one. It is not a sign of relaxation. The
            larger number merely reflects the proliferation of news websites run by
            state-owned media. More important to note are sources that are no longer
            listed. The most conspicuous is Caixin Online, a popular and trusted website.


            Since its launch in 2009, Caixin Online has been an outlier in China’s
            drab media landscape. It often goes far beyond other outlets with investigative
            reporting and coverage of topics such as corruption, environmental problems
            and touchy policy debates. In the early stages of the pandemic it called
            into question the official death toll in Wuhan, pointing to an unusual
            workload at crematoria. Its founder, Hu Shuli, previously ran a magazine
            called Caijing, which once occupied a similar niche. Ms Hu is politically
            well-connected and has a keen sense of how to skate close to—but rarely
            over—the party’s red lines.


            She and her colleagues may feel the effects of another recent tightening
            of the party’s grip. On October 8th China’s planning agency, the National
            Development and Reform Commission ( NDRC ), released a draft regulation
            reiterating a ban on private investment in most news operations. Such
            restrictions have been in place since at least 2005, but have not been
            rigorously enforced. State media suggest that this time, change is afoot.
            According to one widely quoted Chinese expert, previously non-compliant
            arrangements will be ”cleaned up”. It will be a big job. Like Caixin,
            many Chinese media, though fully operated and controlled by the state,
            have complex ownership structures that include big holdings by private
            investors.


            Pro-government commentators have praised the party’s resolve. Sima Nan,
            a blogger in Beijing with more than 2.4m followers on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like
            platform, opined that a loosening of media controls in the Soviet Union
            had hastened its collapse in 1991. “This is an ideological struggle,”
            he said, comparing the NDRC ‘s ban to “removing firewood from under a
            cauldron”—a common way in Chinese of describing drastic action taken to
            deal with an emergency.'

        title: China’s test of a hypersonic missile worries America
        text: 'I N LATE JULY a Chinese Long March rocket streaked into space, much
            like the dozens that took off last year. But having begun to orbit the
            Earth, this rocket’s payload then lurched downwards, glided through the
            upper atmosphere and finally crashed to the ground. American officials
            were stunned, says the Financial Times, which recently broke news that
            this had been a test of a nuclear-capable hypersonic glider (China denies
            it). China conducted another such experiment a couple of weeks later,
            says the newspaper.


            The novelty of such gliders is not that they are unusually fast—in some
            cases, they are slower than an intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM
            ) as it re-enters the atmosphere—but that they are manoeuvrable. A Russian
            or Chinese ICBM fired at America travels over the North Pole and high
            into space, visible to radar systems in the Arctic, and then plunges back
            down in a predictable way (see diagram).


            Gliders are also taken up on rockets but they are released much lower
            and re-enter the atmosphere very quickly, if they leave it at all, making
            them less visible to radar. Then they cruise, unpowered, over long distances,
            allowing them to take convoluted routes that skirt around missile defences.
            America and the Soviet Union experimented with gliders in the cold war.
            Many others are doing so today.


            China’s tests, however, involved a twist. The gliders did not simply go
            up and coast down, but also circled the Earth in space. This is similar
            to the approach employed by the Soviet Union’s Fractional Orbital Bombardment
            System—fractional because it did not involve a full revolution around
            the Earth—which was deployed between 1969 and 1983. The advantage of an
            orbital weapon is that it can go over the South Pole and reach America
            from a direction where the country has neither ground-based radar nor
            perfect coverage from infra-red satellites that can spot rocket engines.'

        title: The confidence of China’s Communist Party is striking
        text: 'S INCE THE Ming dynasty, Chinese who are oppressed by local officials
            have sighed, by way of explanation: “The heavens are high, and the emperor
            far away.” An earthier variant runs: “With no tiger in the mountains,
            the monkeys are in charge.” Today’s Communist Party bosses have no time
            for such cynicism. They want the masses to believe that, even in the remotest
            villages, their welfare is the concern of an all-knowing leader, Xi Jinping,
            served by officials striving to follow his stern but wise example.

            Inspiring the public is not the party’s only concern. A central task of
            the Xi era is to transform morale among the country’s 90m party members,
            including millions of bureaucrats. Officials are told that they serve
            a rising China, whose growing strength is the awe of the world. Since
            Mr Xi became supreme leader in 2012, party membership has been presented
            as something close to a secular priesthood, in which a select few selflessly
            serve the masses. Government ministries in Beijing play their part in
            spreading the faith. Their high-flying staff—almost always party members—compete
            for the career-enhancing honour of a stint as grassroots officials in
            impoverished villages and towns.


            Central government departments have sponsored a growing number of poor
            counties around the country since 1992, when the State Council first urged
            ministries to pair up with left-behind places. Chaguan recently spent
            four days in Malipo, a remote county of conical, cloud-topped hills, terraced
            fields and fruit orchards in the southern province of Yunnan, on the border
            with Vietnam. Malipo has been sponsored for 29 years by the foreign ministry,
            which organised (but did not pay for) this reporter’s visit with a delegation
            of officials from the national and provincial governments. The ministry
            uses its connections to help the county, which was declared free of extreme
            poverty in 2019 and last year recorded an average income per person of
            11,984 yuan ($1,874). Foreign embassies and businesses have donated school
            buildings, books and scholarships. On October 17th America’s National
            Basketball Association donated a new basketball court to a middle school
            in Malipo (the NBA is still trying to mend fences in China after a coach
            signalled support for Hong Kong’s democrats, triggering nationalist fury).
            “Of course this is thanks to the foreign ministry,” said the headmaster,
            as teenage pupils intently copied the moves of visiting NBA coaches, or
            shyly asked them for autographs. The nearest city, Wenshan, used to be
            hours away along winding roads. A new motorway opened on October 1st,
            following lobbying by the foreign ministry. A diplomatic charity raised
            funds to build clean water systems for villagers who previously fetched
            water by hand.


            Dozens of younger diplomats have done stints as volunteer teachers in
            primary schools in villages. More importantly, the ministry sends a mid-ranking
            official to serve for a year or two as Malipo’s deputy county chief. Duties
            include conducting foreign policy, for officials in Yunnan must talk to
            Vietnamese counterparts about exchanges of students or travel permits
            for ethnic minorities whose lands straddle the frontier. Both sides regularly
            clear landmines from border areas—a lethal legacy of China’s brief invasion
            of Vietnam in 1979, which still costs locals limbs.


            Domestic tasks also loom. The ministry’s current man in Malipo, Chen Minghuang,
            served in Japan for several years. In addition to seeking inward investments
            for the county, he is, among other things, responsible for water quality
            in several rivers. Asked why a non-specialist can be entrusted with such
            work, a local official praises foreign-ministry volunteers for their promotional
            skills. Diplomats may not know how to raise a pig, but they can spot what
            makes a pig from Malipo marketable, she enthuses.


            Chaguan ventures at one point that an Oxbridge-educated British diplomat
            may receive a thin welcome if sent to help run a county in rural Scotland,
            without any experience in local government. China is not so hung up about
            elitism, it turns out. The foreign ministry sends “the best of the best”,
            responds an official from Beijing. It sends party members, because they
            are expected to be moral exemplars. “Compared with the masses, party members
            represent more progressive and developed forces. That’s how they can help
            the people,” says the visitor from Beijing. A years-long anti-corruption
            drive has created a culture of honesty among officials of all ranks, she
            adds. At an agricultural training base, local officials offer a broad
            defence of rule by technocrats. Farmers may not understand which crops
            will grow well, and which will make money, says a county official. The
            role of experts is to guide them to harness market forces.


            Heaven near at hand, and the emperor close by


            Some may dismiss all this as a mere propaganda tour. Certainly, the delegation
            was only taken to handsomely restored villages and model farms, and greeted
            by folk dancers at every turn. It would take many days of independent
            reporting to assess the foreign ministry’s help, not to mention its sustainability.
            Malipo is just one of 88 counties in Yunnan formerly ranked as extremely
            poor.


            But a visit to Malipo is a window on something else important. Lots of
            officials are increasingly proud of the system they serve, especially
            as they survey what they regard as chaos in the West. More than before
            they talk openly about the party’s role in that system. As Mr Chen puts
            it, millions of party members are working towards the same goals, guided
            by strong leaders. He describes the changing views of Malipo’s masses
            as they see their roads being paved, and houses and schools restored.
            “The central government always enjoyed a high status in people’s minds.
            Now local government’s reputation has also risen,” Mr Chen says.


            Mr Xi’s China remains a big country with complex problems, run by men
            who see a world full of hostile forces. But the domestic confidence of
            its ruling party is unmistakable. Outsiders miss that tigerish swagger
            at their peril. '

        title: In Xinjiang, officials are trying to stamp out Uyghur identity
        text: 'O FFICIALS IN XINJIANG have always been suspicious of the distinctive
            cultural identity of ethnic Uyghurs. They worry that it may fuel separatist
            yearnings in the far-western region. But in 2014, as the authorities stepped
            up their campaign to crush terrorism there, the government still tolerated
            displays of pride in Uyghur culture. In October that year a new talent
            show, “The Voice of the Silk Road”, aired on state-owned Xinjiang Television.
            It featured songs in various styles, from pop and R & B to traditional
            muqam music with lyrics influenced by classical poetry. The judges mostly
            spoke in Uyghur.

            When China began to open up in the late 1970s, after the death of Mao
            Zedong, Uyghur culture was allowed to flourish, as long as it avoided
            any hint of support for a separate Uyghur state. Uyghur writers produced
            poems and songs filled with universally familiar themes such as love and
            loss, but also conveying pride in their identity. They created innovative
            blends of muqam with rock and hip-hop that turned a few Uyghurs into household
            names in China. Songs in such styles were aired on “The Voice of the Silk
            Road”.


            There was nothing politically edgy about the show. It was merely a regional
            adaptation of a national hit, “The Voice of China” (which is still running).
            But it fell victim to a security clampdown, launched in response to sporadic
            attacks by Uyghurs on Chinese belonging to the ethnic-Han majority. Since
            2017 some of the show’s stars have disappeared into a vast new gulag in
            which more than 1m people, most of them Uyghurs, have been locked up.


            Officials say the camps offer “vocational education” to help Uyghurs find
            better jobs and to curb their “extremist” tendencies. But many of those
            detained have shown no more sign of extremism than simply being devout
            Muslims. Often, as with those involved in “The Voice of the Silk Road”,
            their crime has been to show too much enthusiasm for Uyghur culture, not
            necessarily just Islam.


            Those rounded up who were linked with the show include Zahirshah Ablimit,
            who came second in the competition of 2014, and Muhtar Bugra, a businessman
            and poet who was its financier and head producer. Both were eventually
            released. Still thought to be inside are Memetjan Abduqadir, another producer
            who is also an actor and singer, and Mekhmutjan Sidiq, the director of
            Xinjiang Television.


            Uyghur groups in the West reckon that the four are among nearly 400 intellectuals
            and cultural figures who have been detained in the new camps, sent to
            regular prisons or who have otherwise disappeared since the clampdown
            began. Some are well known in the region: Perhat Tursun, a novelist and
            poet; Tashpolat Tiyip, the president of Xinjiang University; Rahile Dawut,
            a scholar of Uyghur folklore; and Ablajan Ayup, an actor and singer sometimes
            described as a Uyghur Justin Bieber. Others associated with Uyghur culture
            have been paraded on state television praising the virtues of the Communist
            Party or singing patriotic songs.


            The chill had begun even before the airing of the first episode of “The
            Voice of the Silk Road”. In September 2014 Ilham Tohti, a revered academic
            with moderate political views, was sentenced to life in prison for separatism.
            Mr Tohti had maintained a website that hosted writing by Uyghur intellectuals
            on social and cultural issues. He had dared to call for more enlightened
            official treatment of his ethnic group.


            Today the only Uyghur culture allowed in China is of a token kind, conforming
            to a stereotype endorsed by the party such as smiling Uyghurs wearing
            brightly coloured traditional costume, dancing in public squares and singing,
            often in Mandarin. On September 29th, at a side event during a meeting
            in New York of the UN General Assembly, Chinese diplomats showed a video
            of such performances. It was called “Xinjiang is a Wonderful Land”.


            Uyghurs living in exile in the West have been waging a parallel campaign
            to keep their culture alive. It has involved airing the works of underground
            artists in Xinjiang whose songs and poems explore more politically risky
            themes such as oppression and alienation, says Mukaddas Mijit, a specialist
            in Uyghur music living in France. As repression has tightened, she says,
            the works of such musicians and poets have become increasingly suffused
            with lament and despair.


            Some writing has even emerged from the camps, such as poetry by Abduqadir
            Jalalidin, an academic. His verses were memorised by other inmates who
            relayed them to the outside world. “In this forgotten place I have no
            lover’s touch”, one begins. “Each night brings darker dreams, I have no
            amulet / My life is all I ask, I have no other thirst / These silent thoughts
            torment, I have no way to hope.” The translation is by Joshua Freeman
            of Princeton University, a former student of his.


            In 2022 a novel by Mr Tursun, one of the detained writers, will be published
            abroad in English. Called “The Backstreets”, it first appeared online,
            in Uyghur, in 2013. The surreal fable echoes Ralph Ellison’s classic novel
            “Invisible Man”, about a black American who does not feel fully seen (Mr
            Tursun was influenced by Ellison). On a street in Urumqi, Xinjiang’s capital,
            the narrator meets a man who vows to “chop” to death everyone in southern
            Xinjiang, a mostly Uyghur area. The man vanishes into the fog and the
            narrator muses: “I would always be the one he was going to chop, even
            though we didn’t know each other.”


            Mr Tursun’s writings and links with other cultural personalities in Xinjiang
            may have led to his detention in 2018 and his reported jail term of 16
            years. A public figure in Urumqi, his politics had once been officially
            acceptable. He had even criticised Uyghur ethno-nationalism.


            But displays of loyalty to the party are no longer enough to keep people
            safe. In 2017 Shireli Eltekin, a famous singer, released “A Song for Leader
            Xi Jinping”, a paean to China’s president. It includes fawning lyrics
            such as: “You put light into the hearts of the people.” Uyghurs in exile
            were dismayed to hear a much-loved performer crooning for the regime.
            But one night in June he was taken away from his home in his pyjamas,
            says a family friend.


            In 2018 “The Voice of the Silk Road” was discontinued.It returned last
            year, with changes. Introducing the new series, the host made approving
            remarks about building socialism in Xinjiang and loving the party. In
            this year’s competition, the first contestant to take to the stage sang
            a Uyghur-language song from the 1950s called “Leader Mao Zedong”. In the
            show’s early days, this would have been “unimaginable”, says Elise Anderson
            of the Uyghur Human Rights Project in Washington, an American ethnomusicologist
            who competed in the inaugural series of “The Voice of the Silk Road” in
            2014.


            Such popular entertainment used to suggest at least some official acceptance
            of Uyghur culture. Now it is evidence of its suppression. Ms Anderson
            worries that, inside China, “only a Potemkin version” may survive.

        title: How long can China’s zero-covid policy last?
        text: 'F ROM THE outside, it resembles an army base, an expanse the size of
            45 football pitches filled with rows of austere, grey, three-storey buildings.
            The facility (pictured) on the outskirts of the southern city of Guangzhou
            is China’s first purpose-built quarantine centre for people arriving from
            abroad. Soon guests will begin moving in to its more than 5,000 rooms.
            For at least two weeks, whether fully vaccinated or not, they will live
            in isolation, their food brought to them by robots.

            Since the early days of the covid-19 pandemic, China’s aim has been to
            eliminate the coronavirus entirely from within the mainland’s borders.
            Hong Kong and Macau have similar strategies. But even as the handful of
            other countries with “zero-covid” policies, including Australia, New Zealand
            and Singapore, move to relax them, China is holding out.


            The point of Guangzhou’s $260m facility is to make it even harder for
            the virus to enter the country, by keeping people quarantined away from
            densely populated areas. People flying into the city from outside the
            mainland will be whisked there directly, instead of to normal hotels,
            for at least two weeks of confinement and frequent testing. Even the medical
            staff may not leave the premises. After working there for four weeks,
            they must do a week of quarantine and then, after returning home, spend
            another two weeks in isolation.


            Chinese officials describe the complex as the latest example of “China
            speed”: it took just three months to build. Another dedicated quarantine
            centre (unlike Guangzhou’s, not built from scratch) is also due to open
            soon in the nearby city of Dongguan. It will have 2,000 beds. Officials
            have ordered cities elsewhere to follow suit. In September, at a training
            session for medical staff in Guangzhou’s facility, an official tried to
            fire them up with a well-known term used by Mao Zedong to describe a relentless,
            long-lasting campaign to wear down the enemy with guerrilla attacks. It
            would be a “protracted war” against the virus, he said. “It can only end
            when the disease is no longer around.”


            China’s zero-covid policy involves keeping most foreigners out, meticulous
            quarantines, huge manpower, track-and-trace apps, intense lockdowns in
            areas where the virus is found and frequent mass testing. A recent traveller
            to China from New York describes having to submit photographs of her pre-departure
            covid test to the Chinese consulate-general to prevent any fakery. Two
            pictures, taken by a nurse, were of blood being drawn from her arm and
            a swab up her nose. Another, by clinic staff, showed her at the entrance,
            holding her passport and a test certificate.


            Such efforts have achieved impressive results, given the size of the country
            and the porousness, in normal times, of its land borders with some of
            its 14 neighbours. By October 10th China’s official tally of covid-related
            deaths stood at 4,636. Only three had occurred since April last year.
            Some provinces have seen no fatalities at all, including Jiangsu on the
            coast. It has a population of more than 80m, nearly as big as that of
            Germany where the official death toll is 94,000. To the Chinese authorities,
            a big outbreak is one involving dozens or, rarely, hundreds of cases:
            barely a blip in the statistics of most other countries.


            If the world were to face a similar outbreak again, knowing what it does
            now, many countries would choose China’s approach. But eventually they
            would face the same question: when to relax those measures? As the rest
            of the world begins to get used to covid as an endemic disease—always
            present but contained at a level that people consider acceptable—how long
            will China keep up its enormous campaign to crush it altogether?


            It is an important question, of concern not only to China’s 1.4bn people,
            but worldwide. Consider just one side-effect of China’s zero-covid approach:
            the inability of world leaders to meet China’s president, Xi Jinping,
            face-to-face. Mr Xi has not received foreign visitors or travelled abroad
            since January 2020. He is unlikely to attend a meeting of the G 20 in
            Rome at the end of October, or a subsequent UN climate-change conference
            in Glasgow. At a time of potentially dangerous tensions with America,
            he has yet to hold a formal summit with President Joe Biden. On October
            6th China agreed to such a meeting later this year, but only by video
            link.


            Mr Xi’s hard choice


            Several factors will affect China’s decisions about when and how to change
            its policy. They include the way the virus mutates, the effectiveness
            of its vaccines (China does not allow the use of foreign ones), risks
            to the economy and the public mood. The Communist Party has hailed its
            success in crushing the coronavirus as evidence of the superiority of
            China’s political system. Accepting that the virus is endemic would involve
            a big change of tune.


            The Delta variant, now dominant globally, is making China’s policy a lot
            harder to implement. It spreads two to three times more easily than the
            original strain, which was first detected in the central Chinese city
            of Wuhan. But such problems may be offset by a high rate of vaccination.
            By September 15th, the latest date for which data are available, 71% of
            Chinese had received two jabs and another 10% had received their first
            (see chart 1). By comparison, 56% of Americans and 64% of EU residents
            had got two shots by October 11th.


            However, China is unlikely to relax its policy soon. The imminent opening
            of Guangzhou’s high-tech quarantine centre hints at this. The National
            Health Commission has recommended that workers at airports, borders and
            quarantine sites be given priority for booster shots. Such people are
            most likely to be exposed to infections brought from abroad. If the zero-covid
            policy were about to be abandoned, those most in need of booster jabs
            would be vulnerable people such as the elderly, who would be infected
            locally. By September 15th China had given two jabs to nearly three-quarters
            of people over 60. But even if it succeeds in vaccinating almost all of
            them, as some countries in Europe have achieved, hospitalisations will
            still increase after the country starts opening up. By how much will depend
            on the jabs. China has approved seven vaccines, all of them produced by
            Chinese firms. The two most widely used are made by Sinovac, a private
            company, and Sinopharm, which is state-owned. Both have been endorsed
            by the World Health Organisation. They are based on a traditional kind
            of vaccine technology, using an inactivated form of the SARS -CoV-2 virus.
            Like the West’s vaccines, China’s work well at preventing serious illness
            but less so at stopping covid’s spread. It is hard to compare them more
            precisely. Few studies have tried doing so among comparable groups of
            people, at the same time and in the same place. There are not enough infections
            in China to enable effective vaccine-testing. So most data have been gathered
            elsewhere. Most trials have involved exposure to non-Delta variants. A
            study of 61m vaccinated people in Brazil, conducted when most infections
            there were caused by the Gamma type, found that Sinovac’s vaccine was
            75% effective against hospitalisation, and AstraZeneca’s 90%. In Chile,
            Uruguay and Indonesia Sinovac’s jab has been used in national vaccination
            campaigns. It has proved 85-95% effective in these against hospitalisation
            and death. Like the Western vaccines, it works less well among the elderly.
            There are fewer data relating to Sinopharm’s shots. But they, too, seem
            less effective than some of the vaccines used in the West. In Bahrain
            people vaccinated with Sinopharm had higher rates of infection, hospitalisation
            and death than those who had received Pfizer’s or AstraZeneca’s jab—especially
            if they were aged over 50 at the time when Delta became dominant.


            China could try to strengthen its defences by allowing the use of Western
            vaccines. But it is determined to rely on home-grown solutions. One reason
            is clearly political: the party wants to be seen as the sole enabler of
            China’s salvation from the virus. For a while, state media suggested that
            the West’s vaccines were shoddy. An application in China for approval
            of Pfizer’s vaccine, made in partnership with BioNTech using an advanced
            technology known as m RNA, has made little progress. Two million doses
            of it that were meant for China have been sent to Taiwan instead.


            It is possible that China will develop better vaccines. Its army has been
            working with two private Chinese firms on an m RNA type. But it may not
            work well. China is a latecomer to the technology. An m RNA vaccine made
            by CureVac, a German company with long experience in the field, proved
            only 47% effective in trials. It may be a long time before China feels
            confident enough in its vaccines to consider scrapping the zero-covid
            policy.


            Might economic malaise force China’s hand? The country’s repeated skirmishes
            in recent months with Delta-related outbreaks have prompted sudden and
            severe lockdowns. Combined with a longer-running campaign against property
            speculation, these may have sent the economy into a “double-dip” contraction,
            according to Ting Lu of Nomura, a bank. He thinks China’s GDP shrank by
            0.2% in the three months from July to September (compared with the previous
            quarter), following a spectacular first dip when the pandemic struck (see
            chart 2).


            Other recent data also look gloomy. During China’s national-day holiday
            from October 1st to 7th, people took about 58m trips a day across the
            country, official data show. That was about a third less than in 2019
            and also 7.5% less than they took last year. By contrast, during this
            year’s five-day public holiday in May, the number of trips exceeded pre-pandemic
            levels. But although China’s fight against covid has hurt services, its
            exports have been strong. Indeed China’s periodic, pointillist lockdowns
            have been less disruptive to its factories and trade than the more sweeping
            restrictions imposed in manufacturing rivals like Vietnam. China has benefited
            from covid-related shifts in buying patterns in foreign countries, where
            people stuck at home have been splurging on goods such as electronics
            and exercise gear. China makes such things aplenty. How would the economy
            have fared if the Delta variant had spread more widely? China’s weak retail
            spending is in part due to covid-related controls. But it is also caused
            by fear of the virus, which would only deepen if China were to lower its
            guard. Chinese people are right to worry. Huge social stigma surrounds
            anyone who gets the virus and thereby triggers a lockdown. Such a person
            also faces legal sanctions. And the health-care system is weak. The number
            of intensive-care beds per 100,000 people in China—about 3.6—is much closer
            to the level of India than to that of rich countries. In overseas markets,
            Chinese shares have suffered heavy sell-offs in recent weeks, wiping more
            than $1trn off the value of some of the country’s biggest tech firms.
            But this has reflected anxiety about new regulatory moves, not about China’s
            economic prospects under an indefinite zero-covid regime. Foreign businesspeople
            in China certainly grumble. One reason is that the government is reluctant
            to grant visas to spouses or children. An American who runs two businesses
            in China had a baby in America during the pandemic. He cannot return even
            though he and his wife have a visa. The total population of non-mainlanders
            in Beijing and Shanghai fell from about 316,000 a decade ago to just 226,800
            last year, census data show. Those who remain are often treated with suspicion
            by strangers, who view them as potential virus-carriers. A campaign encouraging
            people to report foreign “spies” does not help.


            But despite such gloom, foreign direct investment in China amounted to
            nearly $114bn in the first eight months of 2021, more than one-quarter
            higher than in the same period of 2019. Less than one-tenth of European
            firms are thinking of diverting investment away from the country, the
            European Chamber of Commerce in China reports. In 2015 about one-sixth
            were.


            Some Chinese experts have aired suggestions that, when vaccination rates
            are high enough and death rates low, China should abandon zero-covid.
            In a recent on-camera interview with a Chinese magazine, China’s most
            senior disease-control official, Gao Fu, said the country may reach a
            vaccination rate of 85% by early next year. At that point, Mr Gao asked:
            “Why don’t we open up?” He also said China should study Mao’s protracted-war
            idea in the fight against the virus. But he suggested this would involve
            living with it.


            Mr Gao, however, is not a member of the ruling Politburo, whose members
            may have considerations unrelated to epidemiology. One is that there appears
            to be strong public support for the zero-covid approach. In June online
            commentators excoriated one of China’s most respected scientists, Zhang
            Wenhong, for suggesting that the country should relax the policy next
            year. Official media appeared to echo such criticism by publishing the
            views of a former health minister (whose background is in finance) expressing
            “astonishment” at the idea of easing controls. In August a teacher was
            detained for 15 days after suggesting that Yangzhou relax its lockdown.
            He, too, was vilified on the internet.


            People applaud the lengths to which the government goes to keep the virus
            out and stop it from spreading. Some wealthier Chinese may resent the
            difficulty they now face going abroad on holiday, or even getting a passport
            (the police have become much more reluctant to issue them). But many people
            have little sympathy with their travails. Travelling internally can involve
            much hassle. At motorway checkpoints on the edge of Beijing cars often
            have to join lengthy queues so that police can scan the ID cards of people
            entering the city, check their health apps and record other details. But
            if there is anger over such bothersome procedures, people swallow it.


            As for the enforcers, many of them have a stake in the status quo, too.
            During the pandemic, grassroots Communist Party committees have been re-energised.
            Their chiefs, once sidelined by rapid social and economic change, have
            gained new authority to mobilise people and deploy resources to control
            covid. They will not readily return to their often-marginalised pre-pandemic
            state, nor does the party want them to. It hopes that its street-level
            workers will play a bigger role in maintaining order in urban neighbourhoods,
            using skills honed during the pandemic.


            The party may see other political benefits from keeping the zero-covid
            policy. It faces a series of big public events that it will not want overshadowed
            by outbreaks that raise embarrassing questions at home about its vaunted
            ability to defeat the virus. In February Beijing will host the Winter
            Olympics; the annual session of China’s rubber-stamp parliament, the National
            People’s Congress, will be held in March; and late in the year the party
            will convene a five-yearly congress which Mr Xi (bathed in glory, he surely
            hopes, for his victory over covid) will use as a launching pad for five
            more years, at least, in office.


            A human-rights storm is already brewing around the winter games. Activists
            and politicians in the West have called for boycotts in protest against
            China’s human-rights abuses in the far-western region of Xinjiang and
            its repression in Hong Kong. On September 29th, however, the International
            Olympic Committee announced China’s decision that, to keep the virus in
            check, no spectators will be allowed from outside the country—the same
            restriction that applied to this year’s summer games in Tokyo. This will
            much reduce the risk of foreign visitors marring the events with protests.
            As for possible boycotts by Western leaders, China may avoid that problem
            by not inviting them.


            Again, many Chinese applaud. As China’s leaders consider possible harm
            that may be caused in the long term by clinging to their zero-covid policy,
            the rise of nationalism at home is not among their concerns. The party
            has deliberately fed it with West-blaming and West-scorning rhetoric,
            suggesting that the only morally correct approach is to eliminate the
            virus entirely. Many Chinese, encouraged by state media, believe the West
            has been peddling falsehoods about the origins of the virus in order to
            make their country look bad. Such sentiments have made the poisonous atmosphere
            surrounding China’s relations with the West, evident well before the pandemic,
            even more toxic.


            When China does eventually declare that the virus need not be eliminated,
            its reopening to the world will not necessarily be greeted with joy by
            many of its citizens. They see a West that has rejected China during the
            pandemic, not the other way round. Their bitterness will be long-lasting,
            and not about the zero-covid policy.

        title: How Xi Jinping’s China differs from Mao’s
        text: 'F OR SEVERAL big reasons it is misleading, even morally indecent, when
            commentators assert that China is embarking on a new Cultural Revolution.
            It is true that the Communist Party is today more visible and assertive
            than at any time since Mao Zedong’s death in 1976. After Xi Jinping became
            China’s leader in 2012, he unblushingly re-emphasised the party’s authority
            over everything from the machinery of state and the armed forces to the
            judiciary, universities and news media.

            It is also true that the rich and famous are under harsher scrutiny than
            they have known for decades. Tycoons and film stars have received painful
            reminders that they enjoy their success at the party’s pleasure. Some
            have lost fortunes or seen careers ended for defying China’s leaders,
            or for provoking public opinion with displays of swaggering privilege.
            Others have hastened to donate money and time to patriotic causes. New
            rules ban effeminate actors from television and curb how many hours youngsters
            spend on video games. State power is now invested in one man, Mr Xi, in
            a way not seen since the Mao era. Whether issuing textbooks in Xi Jinping
            Thought to six-year-old children or using smartphone apps to ensure that
            officials study Mr Xi’s wisdom, the leader’s sternly paternal presence
            is felt in every corner of life.


            Yet this is not a return of the Cultural Revolution. Most simply, between
            1966 and 1976 Mao and his inner circle unleashed such horrors on China
            that it dishonours their victims to take that decade’s name in vain. Scholars
            outside China, drawing on often-secret official reports from the 1980s,
            estimate that 1.6m died, with the lives of many millions more ruined.
            Much attention has been paid to the youngest Red Guards: Mao-revering
            students or youths who persecuted everyone from ex-landlords to intellectuals
            and artists, religious believers and, not least, officials accused of
            being reactionary. But more casualties died in fighting between rival,
            adult Red Guard factions or with army units. The violence at times resembled
            a civil war, set in motion after Mao came to doubt the loyalty and revolutionary
            fervour of the ruling establishment. In contrast, Mr Xi and his inner
            circle are iron-fisted party-builders, not friends to rebels. They have
            purged internal rivals, dissenters and the corrupt. The party is now attacking
            what it deems the excesses of capitalism. The goal is stability and conformity,
            with all China marching in lockstep towards national greatness.


            Those are large reasons to avoid miscasting Mr Xi as a second Mao. But
            there are myriad smaller ones, too. By way of a case study, consider an
            ongoing campaign against “superstitious” ways of mourning the dead, specifically
            by burning imitation banknotes and paper models of goods that loved-ones
            might need in the afterlife. In addition to funeral offerings, goods are
            burned for the dead at various annual holidays. One coming soon is Hanyi
            Jie, or the Winter Clothing Festival, when paper replicas of warm clothes
            may be seen burning on city pavements or in village courtyards. In August
            nationwide debate was sparked by news reports that Shanxi, a northern
            province, had drafted rules banning the making or selling of funeral supplies,
            such as paper models of people, horses and houses; or imitation money.
            This was not the first such online uproar. Other provinces, cities and
            counties have tried to stop or restrict the burning of paper offerings
            several times. Officials call the practice superstitious, a source of
            air pollution, a fire hazard and extravagant, scolding citizens to spend
            money on caring for the old, not when burying them.


            China’s best-known paper funeral-goods come from one place. Mibeizhuang,
            an unlovely village in Hebei province 120km south of Beijing, was famed
            for silk flowers as far back the Qing dynasty. Locals boast that wreaths
            at Mao’s funeral came from Mibeizhuang. The village became a nationwide
            hub for funeral-goods when market reforms began in the 1980s. When Chaguan
            visited on a recent weekday, shopkeepers had bundles of paper suits and
            fur-collared coats ready for Hanyi Jie. A group of four men, funeral organisers
            from Wu’an, a rural town 400km to the south-west, loaded a small truck
            with cardboard models of trees covered in gold coins, food-stuffed fridges,
            televisions and pink, colonnaded mansions. A set of such models sells
            for less than 50 yuan ($7.76).


            For centuries in China, honouring the dead lay at the heart of codes of
            virtuous behaviour. In imperial times, children studied models of filial
            piety including Dong Yong, a man so poor that he sold himself into servitude
            to bury his father properly. During the Cultural Revolution, ancestral
            and clan temples were ransacked, while family altars in Chinese homes
            were smashed by Red Guards or hidden for safety by their owners. When
            victims of Maoist violence were burned or buried without ceremony, the
            lack of proper rites was an extra stab of agony for grieving families.


            The party will not admit it, but Mao traumatised China


            Today, once-cherished customs have a markedly weaker grip. Asked whether
            customers believe that burned funeral-goods reach relatives in the afterlife,
            traders in Mibeizhuang are incredulous. “What day and age is this? It
            is just a tradition,” says one. A third-generation seller of paper offerings
            scoffs: “I don’t even believe in it. Spending money on this stuff is like
            throwing it away.”


            The traders have watched injunctions against their industry tightening
            for years, especially in cities. They are cynical, saying that officials
            who oppose burning funeral-goods will sneak home to burn paper models
            for their own parents. But they are resigned to the possibility that their
            trade may end one day. “We set off firecrackers for thousands of years.
            Now it is not allowed and has stopped,” explains one, calling modern-day
            Chinese “obedient”.


            It is hard to start new rows about feudal superstition, precisely because
            the Cultural Revolution tore up so many roots that tied Chinese to the
            past. Today’s China is bossy, socially conservative and relentlessly controlling.
            Its rise as an authoritarian giant is disruptive enough without mistaking
            it for Maoist fanaticism.'

        title: China is ratcheting up military pressure on Taiwan
        text: 'I T WAS A deliberate provocation, patriotically timed. On October 1st,
            the country’s national day, China flew 38 aircraft, including fighter
            jets and bombers, towards Taiwan (one type, the J -16, is pictured). They
            entered the island’s Air Defence Identification Zone ( ADIZ ), a buffer
            region where intrusions often prompt military alerts. It was the year’s
            daily record. Over the next three days China sent another 111 planes.
            In response, Taiwan scrambled jets, broadcast warnings and tracked the
            Chinese aircraft with missile systems. The island’s defence minister,
            Chiu Kuo-cheng, called it “the toughest situation I have seen in more
            than 40 years of my military life”.

            The skies around Taiwan were quieter as The Economist went to press. On
            October 6th China flew no military planes through the ADIZ . So far none
            of the flights has crossed into Taiwan’s territorial airspace, which extends
            12 nautical miles (about 22km) from the island. The intruders typically
            fly 35 nautical miles or more from the Taiwanese coast. But American officials
            clearly share Mr Chiu’s anxiety. On October 6th America’s secretary of
            state, Antony Blinken, called on China to halt its “provocative” activity
            near Taiwan. Also that day, Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden’s national
            security adviser, conveyed America’s concern at a meeting in Switzerland
            with Yang Jiechi, China’s most senior diplomat and a member of the ruling
            Politburo.


            China is unabashed. Its state media have described the sorties as a demonstration
            of the country’s ability to conduct “a wartime air attack”. In recent
            years China has been ratcheting up displays of its growing military capability,
            especially at sea and in the air, as a warning to Taiwan. Its message
            is that if the island refuses to accept China’s claim to sovereignty over
            Taiwan, China may use force. Mr Chiu, a retired general, told Taiwan’s
            parliament on October 6th that China would be able to mount a full-scale
            invasion of Taiwan by 2025, at a cost that the Communist Party in Beijing
            may consider bearable.


            Taiwan’s ADIZ extends over a part of China’s coast, so it is not surprising
            that Chinese military aircraft often fly into it (see map). But China
            has taken to probing parts of the ADIZ that are much closer to the island,
            skirting around the south-western end of what is known as the “median
            line”, an informal boundary in the Taiwan Strait midway between the island
            and the mainland. China now conducts such flights near southern Taiwan
            almost every day. They could be intended to wear down Taiwan’s defences
            (its air force is much smaller than China’s) and condition it into treating
            big sorties as normal in order to make it easier for China to disguise
            the early phase of an attack as an exercise. Assessing China’s intentions
            is extremely difficult. It is fond of sabre-rattling when it believes
            that Taiwan is moving too close to asserting permanent separation from
            China, or when America cosies up to the island. Recent sorties may relate
            to such developments. Earlier this year the Biden administration secured
            public statements of support for Taiwan from the European Union, the G
            7, Japan and South Korea. September was an especially irksome month: Taiwan
            sought entry to a trans-Pacific free-trade group just after China had
            made the same request and American and British naval ships sailed through
            the Taiwan Strait. On September 15th America, Britain and Australia agreed
            to a security partnership, AUKUS , that is viewed in Beijing as an alliance
            aimed at keeping China in check. In the days that followed, China ramped
            up its flights into Taiwan’s ADIZ . If China’s planes were to edge closer
            to airspace over the island itself, it is unclear how Taiwan would respond.
            Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s president, has said that Taiwanese pilots should
            not be the ones to shoot first—at least not without explicit orders. Taiwan’s
            latest Quadrennial Defence Review, produced this year, was vague about
            this, saying only that the island’s responses should get stronger the
            closer that Chinese aircraft get to the island. Some analysts wonder whether
            a Taiwanese fighter would be authorised to fire anything more than a warning
            shot, even if a Chinese plane were to fly over Taiwanese land. In a forthcoming
            article, two think-tankers in America, Bonny Lin of the Centre for Strategic
            and International Studies and David Sacks of the Council on Foreign Relations,
            note Taiwanese press reports which say that Taiwan may have divided its
            airspace into three zones of engagement: a “surveillance zone” of 30 nautical
            miles, a “warning zone” of 24 nautical miles and a “destruction zone”
            of 12 nautical miles. Ms Lin and Mr Sacks say that if any engagement were
            to lead to the death of a pilot, even accidentally, “both sides would
            be ill-equipped” to keep tensions under control.


            There has been no such casualty since 1958. But accidents have happened
            nearby. In 2001 a mid-air collision off the coast of southern China between
            a Chinese fighter and an American naval spy-plane killed the Chinese pilot.
            The crippled American plane landed at a Chinese military airbase. Ten
            days of tension ensued before the crew were allowed to leave. Twenty years
            later, such an encounter may be far harder to resolve. Relations between
            America and China are considerably worse. China suspended official contacts
            with Taiwan after Ms Tsai became president in 2016 and she failed to endorse
            the view of leaders in Beijing that there is only “one China”.


            Should a crisis occur in Taiwan’s skies, nationalist sentiment in China
            could further complicate matters. Global Times, a jingoistic party tabloid
            in Beijing, declared in April that if Ms Tsai’s government were to continue
            its “hostile” behaviour (working closely with America counts as such,
            it suggested), China’s fighter planes would be prepared to fly across
            the island and disregard the “red line” relating to territorial airspace.
            Ms Tsai appears unfazed. In an upcoming issue of Foreign Affairs, she
            writes that Taiwan hopes to “shoulder more responsibility by being a close
            political and economic partner of the United States and other like-minded
            countries”. She warns that people in Taiwan will “rise up should the very
            existence of Taiwan be under threat”. Such words will not stop the sorties,
            nor assuage fears that a mishap could turn into something far bloodier.

        title: Artists and craftsmen try to preserve the sounds of old Beijing
        text: 'W ITH ONE’S eyes closed, Beijing’s main roads sound like any Chinese
            city. All around is the roar of traffic, punctuated by honks from delivery
            scooters, recorded safety warnings from buses and the occasional bell
            of a rental-bicycle. But in the capital’s last hutongs, as its ancient
            grey-walled alleys are known, fragments of an older soundscape can be
            heard.

            The chirping of caged crickets is one. Hung in the doorways of courtyard
            homes or small shops, the insects bring a rural note into the city. A
            quarter-century ago their song was common. Beijing was still home to cycle
            rickshaws and delivery tricycles. Some riders hung crickets from their
            handlebars, inside spherical cages woven from reeds. Today, cricket-sellers
            cling on, lurking near a motorway bridge in southern Beijing. A big specimen
            sells for 20 yuan ($3). They are heirs to a grand tradition. In imperial
            times, bored courtiers and Manchu army officers spent fortunes on caged
            crickets and songbirds.


            Another relic is the musical clanking of steel plates strung on a cord,
            announcing a knife sharpener’s arrival. Several such specialists still
            work Beijing’s streets. Their sounding-plates, sometimes supplemented
            with a distinctive cry, summon customers from hutong homes and high-rise
            flats. But numbers are falling. “What young man would study this?” asks
            Craftsman Liu, a sharpener for 40 years, as he hones a cleaver on a whetstone
            mounted on his bike.


            An almost-vanished Beijing sound is one of the strangest. An eerie thrumming,
            like the noise of flying saucers in an old science-fiction film, it is
            made by homing pigeons, or more precisely by pigeon whistles. Tiny flutes
            made from bamboo or gourds, these are sewn into the tail feathers of pigeons
            kept in rooftop coops. The birds are released twice a day to circle in
            the sky. Even 20 years ago, it was possible to hear this melancholy noise
            in the hutongs. It was particularly associated with cold winter skies,
            for pigeons moult in summer, making feathers too weak to hold whistles.
            Alas, modern Beijing is a city in a hurry. Many hutongs have been razed
            to make way for wide avenues and shiny skyscrapers, leaving no room for
            pigeon lofts.


            Zhang Baotong is one of Beijing’s last master pigeon-whistle makers. As
            a child in the 1950s he heard the dong of camel bells as dusty caravans
            carried coal to a nearby railway station. He learned to make whistles
            in boyhood from a famed master who shared a courtyard with his family.
            Today Mr Zhang has apprentices and a workshop lined with certificates
            calling him a living treasure. But many of his whistles are sold to collectors
            and never see the sky.


            Mr Zhang is advising a museum of sound that will open next May in Songzhuang,
            a suburb of Beijing that is popular with artists. A rooftop coop is planned,
            with more than 100 pigeons that will take to the skies for visitors. It
            is hoped that pigeon-whistles will be heard each day over Songzhuang,
            at least in cooler months.


            The co-founder of Fen Sonic HQ , a cultural institute that will run the
            museum, is Colin Siyuan Chinnery, a British-Chinese artist and collector
            of Beijing’s sounds. He lists the gongs, rattles and rhythmic cries used
            by fortune tellers and medicine sellers, doctors, barbers and knife sharpeners,
            until private enterprise was crushed in the 1950s. Many of these will
            feature in an exhibit about old Beijing narrated by an animation of Mr
            Zhang, among others. Other places had hawkers’ cries, but true Beijingers
            dismiss peddlers elsewhere as mere bellowers, Mr Chinnery says. Beijingers’
            pride is one tradition that never fades.

        title: A Chinese vision of free trade
        text: 'S OMETIMES CHINA makes shrewd decisions. At other times it is capable
            of grave mistakes, even acts of wickedness. But the Chinese government
            is rarely silly. In particular, officials do not stake the prestige of
            their supreme leader, President Xi Jinping, on a whim. That makes it worth
            revisiting dismissive foreign reactions to a move that, though dry-looking,
            is important and revealing.

            On September 16th China formally asked to join the Comprehensive and Progressive
            Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership ( CPTPP ), an 11-nation trading
            block that is home to 500m consumers in Asia and the Americas. Though
            China’s timing was sudden, the move was predictable. Months ago Mr Xi
            said China would “favourably consider” applying. His word is law. But
            many foreign analysts (and in private, some foreign government officials)
            confidently predict that China will never be admitted.


            Scepticism is understandable. In the name of market opening and fair competition,
            the CPTPP ’s current members—Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan,
            Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam—agree to limit
            subsidies for large state-owned enterprises ( SOE s), permit most cross-border
            flows of data and outlaw forced labour, among many other promises. If
            those standards seem hard for China to meet, given its statist, security-obsessed
            turn in recent years, that is no accident. The CPTPP is the orphaned offspring
            of an earlier, American-led agreement, the TPP . That was crafted by the
            Bush and Obama administrations with the aim of making Asia and the Pacific
            into a bastion of rules-based free trade, leaving China with the choice
            of reforming its model of state-dominated capitalism or remaining on the
            outside. Then came President Donald Trump, whose scorn for free trade
            and indeed rules led him to quit the TPP on his first full day in office.
            When Japan guided other founding members to forge a Trump-less alternative,
            the CPTPP , China spotted an opening.


            Officials in Beijing have spent two years studying how hard it will be
            for China to join. Their conclusion is that China will find accession
            arduous, not least because of strained relations with existing members
            who have a veto, notably Australia, Canada and Japan. But they also reckoned
            that China would face still harsher scrutiny were America to be inside
            the CPTPP —a distant prospect currently, due to Biden administration pledges
            to put American workers ahead of corporate profits and expanded global
            trade.


            China, in short, is serious. Its ambition is best explained by different
            forms of rising confidence, some more alarming than others. Start with
            a benign, cautious optimism among those sometimes called reformers. That
            camp once promoted economic liberalisation. In a China intently focused
            on political control, stability, security and self-reliance, reformers
            now find it safer to push for a more efficient state, not a smaller one.
            These scholars, technocratic officials and business types argue that China
            is so strong and technologically advanced that it gains, on balance, from
            removing barriers to trade and upholding common international rules, for
            instance to protect Chinese intellectual property. Such advocates of openness
            believe that China can compete in a free-trading world, but is not yet
            ready to write trade regulations on its own. They welcome a chance to
            help shape norms during negotiations such as the CPTPP- accession process,
            which they expect to take years. They hope that external pressure will
            overcome special interests at home, as happened when China joined the
            World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) in 2001. Given the consensus in official
            Beijing that America is bent on thwarting China’s rise, pressure from
            the CPTPP —a pact without America in it—is especially welcome. Wang Huiyao
            runs the Centre for China and Globalisation, a think-tank that champions
            CPTPP entry. China’s economy has grown 11-fold since admission to the
            WTO , he notes. It is “an easy sell” to call CPTPP a new chance to join
            a mini- WTO .


            A different sort of confidence moves nationalists, including government
            leaders, who embrace the CPTPP . They do not just think China’s state-led
            system capable of competing in the world. They think it is manifestly
            superior. Nationalist-minded Chinese officials and scholars think that
            market forces bring desirable efficiencies, but their priority is stability,
            which they see as China’s secret weapon. As exhibit A they point to their
            strict, collective handling of the covid-19 pandemic, in contrast with
            grim death tolls in the freedom-obsessed West. Their gamble is that joining
            the CPTPP will increase foreign trade and impose useful disciplines, without
            undermining strong political control of the economy. They sense a historic
            chance to advance a cherished goal, namely to make the world respect China’s
            political system.


            Sceptics about China’s chances assert that CPTPP rules ban subsidies and
            aid for state firms. In fact there are exemptions for local-government
            SOE s and those delivering unprofitable domestic services. In accession
            talks China may accept regulation of SOE s operating abroad in profitmaking
            commercial sectors, while insisting that state firms at home are needed
            to supply jobs, manage critical resources or maintain an orderly financial
            system. China’s ever-stricter rules about cross-border data flows will
            be harder to finesse, though public-order exemptions may help. China simply
            denies it has forced labour, daring trade partners to disbelieve it.

        title: Xi Jinping’s clampdowns herald a tense political year in China
        text: 'T HE TERM “cake theory” has a resonance in China that goes far beyond
            the kitchen. A decade ago it became shorthand for a fierce debate about
            the country’s future. There were two opposing camps. One believed that
            China should focus on making China’s cake—its economy—bigger. The other
            said the priority should be to share the existing cake more fairly. It
            was a feud that permeated the febrile politics of China in the build-up
            to Xi Jinping’s anointment as the Communist Party’s chief in 2012. A powerful
            advocate of the sharing approach was later accused of plotting a coup.

            The political landscape in China now looks different. There is no sign
            of a struggle, as there was during the cake debate, between the party’s
            titans. Less than a year after Mr Xi took over, the alleged coup-plotter,
            Bo Xilai, was sentenced to life in prison for corruption and abuse of
            power. Similar fates befell several others close to him, including the
            man once in charge of China’s domestic-security apparatus. Mr Xi looks
            firmly in charge. There are no provincial party chiefs waging thinly disguised
            battles for national power as Mr Bo was then, in his case by casting himself
            as a champion of the poor.


            But there are striking similarities. Once again, the political atmosphere
            is heating up. Mr Bo’s mantra then, the need to create “common prosperity”,
            has become Mr Xi’s. Regulators have staged a series of dramatic strikes
            against some of the country’s biggest tech firms, wiping more than a trillion
            dollars off their share values and sowing widespread alarm among wealthy
            Chinese businesspeople. The government, eager to reduce dangerous levels
            of debt, has allowed a giant privately owned property firm, Evergrande,
            to teeter on the brink of collapse, sending jitters through global markets
            and sparking protests by angry investors and contractors in several cities.
            The party does not publicly justify these moves in the name of common
            prosperity, but there are plenty of online commentators in China who see
            the pursuit of that nebulous goal as well-served by anything that creates
            pain for the super-rich. China''s underdogs are enjoying a moment of Schadenfreude.


            An important link exists between recent events in China and the struggles
            of a decade ago. It is the approach of a crucial party congress. Such
            gatherings occur every five years. The next is expected to be held late
            in 2022. Those that take place ten years into a leader’s rule—like both
            next year’s and the one in 2012—are particularly important.


            Normally such a congress would involve sweeping changes in the party leadership,
            with the election of a new Central Committee that in turn chooses a new
            general secretary and reshuffles the Politburo (in fact, these changes
            are decided in secret before the congress begins). After next year’s congress
            Mr Xi is expected to secure another five years in office—a break with
            precedent that, by the time of the 21st congress in 2027, would make him
            the longest-serving party chief since Mao Zedong.


            As always in the build-up to such events, tension is evident as the party
            tries to forestall any unrest by ratcheting up security. Early this year
            a nationwide purge began of the police, secret police, judiciary and prison
            system. Its stated aims include stamping out corruption, as well as removing
            the “lingering poison” of Mr Bo and his alleged clique. More than 170,000
            people have been punished so far, officials say. This month investigation
            teams moved into provincial- and central-government-level departments
            to begin assessing the behaviour and loyalty of high-ranking security
            officials.


            There is no sign of concerted opposition to Mr Xi’s plans to remain in
            power. He has ruled with such ruthlessness that any dissenters are likely
            to keep their mouths shut. But even if he does not face any rival whom
            outsiders can identify, Mr Xi will be on guard. Not only will there be
            the usual jockeying among officials for seats in the party’s highest echelons,
            but also—as was the case a decade ago—internal debate about China’s direction.
            At the congress, Mr Xi will present a report summing up his decade in
            power and setting out his vision for his next five (or more) years of
            rule.


            On July 1st, the 100th anniversary of the party’s founding, Mr Xi declared
            that China had become a “moderately prosperous society in all respects”.
            Inside the party, and among the public, many want to know when it will
            become fairer. Mr Xi’s report next year is unlikely to go into specifics
            about taxes and government spending. But to judge from officials’ recent
            emphasis on the common-prosperity theme, it will feature prominently in
            what is sure to be a state-of-the-party address filled with chest-thumping
            references to China’s “resurrection” as a global power that will be modern,
            rich and strong by 2049.


            The pace of recent events suggests Mr Xi is in a hurry. He has clamped
            down not only on big business but also on the entertainment sector. Ideological
            education in schools has been reinforced: children as young as six are
            being taught about “Xi Jinping Thought”.


            And as often happens when congresses approach, ideology is becoming a
            bone of contention. Since the launch of the country’s “reform and opening”
            policy in 1978, a huge gap has emerged between the party’s professed socialism
            and China’s reality. The country is much richer, but it practises a Dickensian
            kind of capitalism that offers far less protection to the poor than many
            capitalist societies in the West provide. The disposable income of people
            in the top fifth of Chinese households is ten times higher than those
            in the bottom fifth, official figures show. Credit Suisse, a bank, reckons
            the top 1% own more than 30% of household wealth, about the same as in
            America. Mr Xi appears to enjoy the support of many Chinese, not least
            for beefing up China’s global power and fighting corruption at home. Since
            last year, his popularity appears to have grown as a result of his successful
            efforts to crush the coronavirus and his intransigence in the face of
            what many in China see as the West’s ganging up on their country at the
            instigation of President Joe Biden. Mr Xi has critics within the system,
            but they are scared to show their hand. It may be, in part, with them
            in mind that he is patching an ideological vulnerability by appealing
            to the less well-off. The turmoil of a decade ago suggests how grumblings
            of the poor can be exploited. Mr Xi still snarls about Mr Bo’s “independent
            kingdom” in the south-western region of Chongqing, where he was party
            chief and gained support by tapping in to nostalgia for the more socialist
            features of the Mao era and reviving memories of the late leader by promoting
            Mao-era songs.


            Raising the red flag


            Chinese critics of the country’s state-led capitalism often refer to Mao.
            It is a relatively safe way of poking at the party, which remains officially
            wedded to Maoism and Marxism even though it is highly selective in the
            way it applies those ideologies. Mr Bo—as much a state capitalist as other
            leaders—even tried to show sympathy with the downtrodden by pandering
            to neo-Maoists, a motley bunch whose websites often carp about China’s
            drift from the true socialist path. They comprise various kinds of people.
            Some have retired from the civil service or state-owned firms and yearn
            for what they recall as the simpler, fairer times of Mao. Others are younger
            idealists who grew up in the post-Mao era and abhor its inequalities.
            They are loyalists, but acerbic in their dissection of China’s social
            ills. Few Chinese support their extreme orthodoxy (such as calling, as
            Marx did, for the abolition of private ownership). But many share their
            analysis.


            One reason for Mr Xi’s recent clampdowns may be an attempt to show ordinary
            people that he takes ideology seriously and is on their side. There is
            no sign that he plans to adopt the neo-Maoists’ proposed remedies for
            China’s unfairness. However, like Mr Bo, he is surely conscious that taking
            rich businessmen down a peg or two can win much applause (several were
            targeted in Mr Bo’s anti-corruption drive in Chongqing). Prominent businesspeople
            are frequent targets of online venom, not only from the neo-Maoists. The
            internet has been brimming with complaints from stressed-out white-collar
            workers about long hours and low pay.


            Since he came to power, Mr Xi has been trying hard to convey the impression
            that he is faithful to Marxism and Maoism. “Do not forget the original
            intent” has long been one of his favourite slogans. It means the party
            must bear in mind why it was formed in the first place: most importantly,
            to create a fairer society. The slogan has long been ubiquitous on streets.


            But if Mr Xi is serious about this, it will involve big economic and social
            reforms. He has not spelled out what these might entail, or when they
            will be implemented. He could, for example, levy new taxes on property
            or inheritance. Or he could end the hukou system of household registration
            that gives urban residents far better access to welfare and education
            than their rural counterparts have, and makes it difficult for people
            from the countryside to enjoy such benefits when they move to cities.
            However, there would be huge resistance to all these moves. Such taxes
            have been discussed for years, but officials have dithered because of
            fears of upsetting property-owning middle-class Chinese. Hukou reform
            has been slow, too, in part for similar reasons: middle-class urbanites
            do not want to share schools and hospitals with huge numbers of poor rural
            migrants.


            Details of any reforms, it appears, can wait (the annual session of China’s
            parliament, the National People’s Congress, in March 2023 will be a forum
            to watch). For now, Mr Xi is scoring easy points by attacking the rich
            and famous. In August one of the country’s best-known film stars, Zheng
            Shuang, was fined more than $46m for evading taxes. She is one of several
            celebrities who have recently been blacklisted from the entertainment
            business for various reasons. These range from engaging in casual sex
            to rape and, in the case of one actor, circulating a photo of himself
            grinning in front of a shrine in Tokyo where war criminals are among those
            honoured. Punishing these stars has proved popular.


            Mr Xi is also taking this opportunity to tighten political control. In
            August the state-backed China Federation of Radio and Television Associations
            called for “zero tolerance” of performers who “touch the ethical bottom
            line”. Forbidden behaviour, it said, should include having the “wrong”
            attitudes towards history and the country—code for anything that might
            upset party ideologues. That was made official in September, when the
            broadcasting regulator said the selection of actors should exclude anyone
            with an “incorrect political stance”, as well as those deemed immoral.


            The end of fun?


            In the 1990s, when the party began encouraging private enterprise, it
            also allowed people a degree of personal freedom, at least outside politics.
            Hitherto suppressed forms of art and entertainment, from the avant-garde
            to punk rock, were given freer rein. Mr Xi, however, has been signalling
            that his “Chinese dream” is of a conservative society: Xi Jinping Thought
            is suffused with references to ancient Chinese philosophies stressing
            conformity.


            In its edict this month, the broadcasting regulator also called for a
            “resolute end” to shows featuring “perverse tastes”, such as for effeminate
            men. It banned publication of celebrity rankings: officials want to tame
            their boisterous fan clubs. Separately, to make sure youngsters spend
            more time studying and less time shooting zombies, under-18s have been
            barred from online gaming on weekdays and limited to a mere three hours
            at the weekend.


            There are echoes in this of the 1980s, when the party launched brief campaigns
            against Western lifestyles (such as by forcing men to cut their hair short)
            and liberal beliefs. The question now is whether recent clampdowns represent
            a longer-term shift, involving ever greater party interference in a broad
            range of less-tightly controlled activity. The signs are not encouraging.
            Mr Xi is a harsh authoritarian, differing from Deng Xiaoping who, in the
            1980s, veered between relaxation of cultural and economic freedoms, and
            tighter control. Mr Xi’s direction is far clearer.


            Like Deng, Mr Xi sees a big role for the private sector in boosting economic
            growth and providing jobs. On September 6th Liu He, a deputy prime minister,
            tried to reassure private businesspeople, saying their endeavours were
            critical to the country’s economy. But he wants them on a shorter rein.
            One reason is justifiable. China’s private tech firms have long been in
            need of better policing to curb rampant antitrust abuses, exploitative
            labour practices and misuse of data. Property firms do indeed pose a threat
            to financial stability with their heavy borrowing and Ponzi-like business
            models. But Mr Xi also wants tighter political control of private firms.
            He has devoted great energy to establishing party committees inside them,
            requiring that they have a say in important decision-making. That will
            remain a priority.


            Many people in China seem happy with this. The crumbling of Evergrande
            has triggered small protests by people afraid of losing their down-payments
            on houses, or by contractors who have not been paid. But most people appear
            to believe that the government will protect them from the fallout of the
            company’s troubles.


            Mr Xi is certainly winning applause from the neo-Maoists, and appearing
            to relish it. On August 29th the website of one of the party’s flagship
            newspapers, Guangming Daily, published an article by one such ideologue,
            a little-known writer called Li Guangman. He had posted it a couple of
            days earlier on his blog. It was a paean to the clampdowns, including
            on effeminate men. Mr Li hailed recent developments as a “profound revolution”
            that would “wash away all the dust”. His blog post was a declaration of
            victory: “Red is back, the heroes are back, courage is back.”


            It quickly became clear that Mr Li’s article enjoyed official approval.
            Though not published in the print edition of a big newspaper, within hours
            it appeared on the websites of the party’s most important news organisations.
            Never mind that its Mao-era language caused ripples of unease among liberals
            and even some establishment types. On September 2nd Hu Xijin, the editor
            of Global Times, a tabloid owned by the People’s Daily, used his blog
            to condemn the article as “inaccurate” and “exaggerated”. Mr Hu said he
            was afraid it would cause “terror” by reviving “certain historical memories”—an
            obvious reference to Mao’s Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s,
            when mobs killed and persecuted millions. But the articles remained online.
            Mr Xi certainly does not mind his multi-front campaign being praised as
            a big deal.


            Nothing like the Cultural Revolution appears in the offing. That event
            pushed the country to the brink of civil war. Unlike Mao, Mr Xi is obsessed
            with preserving stability. In May a spokesman for the Ministry of Public
            Security said the emphasis of the police force’s efforts to “protect the
            state’s political security” would be on preventing a “colour revolution”.
            But there is no sign of an incipient one. In the months leading up to
            the congress, the country’s handful of active dissidents will be subjected
            to even tighter surveillance than usual.


            Mr Xi is already remoulding society in a way that neo-Maoists endorse.
            Recent events have taken place against a broader backdrop of more-visible
            involvement by the party in people’s everyday lives. Especially since
            the pandemic began, it has become omnipresent in neighbourhoods in a way
            not seen since the 1980s. Grassroots party members are the chief enforcers
            of quarantines and controllers of people’s movements. In the past two
            years, several central-level documents have promoted the establishment
            of “moral review councils” in the countryside. These are made up of party
            worthies and, sometimes, police officers who sit in judgment on fellow
            villagers’ behaviour and publicly shame those who have committed offences
            such as littering or failing to look after an elderly parent. Some urban
            neighbourhoods have set up similar “moral clinics”.


            Assuming Mr Xi keeps his job as China’s leader at least until 2027, if
            not longer, control will be his watchword, not disruption. “East, west,
            south, north and centre; the party leads everything,” Mr Xi keeps insisting.
            Without ideological discipline, he says, its grip will be dangerously
            weakened. But it is Xi Jinping Thought, not that of Mao or Marx, that
            will really count. He will interpret it as he pleases. '

            silk glove. Depending on political winds back home, China’s envoys learn

            China is in a triumphant mood after Meng Wanzhou, a boss at Huawei, a
            technology firm, was allowed to fly home on September 25th after almost
            three years of legal battles in Canada. Ms Meng, who is also the daughter
            of Huawei’s founder, was fighting extradition to America on charges relating
            to sanctions-busting business dealings with Iran. Celebrations peaked
            with the arrival of an Air China plane bringing Ms Meng to Shenzhen, where
            Huawei is based. State television carried the landing live, as if Ms Meng
            were a returning astronaut. She was greeted by flag-waving crowds and
            a welcome message blazing from Shenzhen’s tallest skyscraper. “Without
            a powerful motherland, I would not have my freedom today,” declared Ms
            Meng. The People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s official mouthpiece, called
            her return a sign that China’s rejuvenation as a great power is now a
            “historical inevitability”.


            Neither the businesswoman nor state television mentioned a less stirring
            reason for her return: her signing, hours earlier, of a Deferred Prosecution
            Agreement offered by American prosecutors, admitting that in 2013 she
            misled bankers in New York about Huawei’s links to a company active in
            Iran. That legal deal ended what Ms Meng called 1,028 days trapped in
            a dark “abyss”. By this she meant her enforced stay in Vancouver, while
            her team of expensive lawyers fought her extradition after her arrest
            by Canadian police in December 2018 on an American warrant. Granted bail,
            Ms Meng lived in her own house, took painting lessons and English classes,
            and was free to explore Vancouver by day.


            Nor, at first, did state television discuss the almost-simultaneous departure
            from China of a plane carrying two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael
            Spavor. The two were snatched by secret police in 2018 just days after
            Ms Meng’s arrest, an act that Canada’s government called an “arbitrary
            detention”. Kept alone in a cell measuring nine square metres, Mr Kovrig
            wrote to his family of passing time with meditation, press-ups, reading
            when allowed and walking 7,000 paces a day, ears ringing from the silence.
            The pair were allowed access to lawyers only after a year of detention
            and interrogations lasting for up to eight hours at a time.


            For a day or two after Ms Meng’s return, state media barely reported the
            two Canadians’ release. Indeed, censors deleted postings by Chinese netizens
            asking about rumours that “Canadian spies” had been freed. Asked if Mr
            Kovrig and Mr Spavor had been hostages swapped for Ms Meng, the foreign
            ministry’s chief spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, called the cases completely
            different. It is “crying wolf” to suggest that China would detain foreigners
            on trumped-up charges, added Ms Hua, before accusing America and Canada
            of the arbitrary detention of Ms Meng.


            Some foreign commentators express surprise that China sprang Mr Kovrig
            and Mr Spavor on the same day that Ms Meng began her journey home. Given
            that China says it deplores hostage-taking, surely it should wait a bit
            before exchanging foreigners for Ms Meng. Puzzlement misses the point.
            China wants the world to know that it is willing to grab foreigners, if
            needs be. More than once, court hearings and legal moves against Mr Kovrig
            and Mr Spavor tracked important moments in Ms Meng’s extradition battle.
            The message was that the cases were linked.


            This is not a guess. Months into the detention of Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor,
            Chaguan discussed the case with a Chinese official at an event in Beijing.
            By then, Canadian diplomats had seen both men for tightly controlled consular
            visits. Mr Spavor is an entrepreneur who organised tours into North Korea.
            He was locked up in the north-eastern city of Dandong, near the North
            Korean border, and would later be sentenced to 11 years for spying. Prosecutors
            said he took pictures at airports and other banned locations, including
            of military planes, and was Mr Kovrig’s informant.


            Mr Kovrig was a diplomat at Canada’s embassy in Beijing before joining
            the International Crisis Group ( ICG ), a think-tank. During hours of
            interrogations, he was asked about his work for ICG but also about his
            role at the embassy, when he enjoyed diplomatic immunity. Word of this
            spread to other embassies in Beijing. In private conversations, diplomats
            called it “frightening”. Chaguan raised this with his host, asking how
            it helps China to scare Western diplomats. The official’s tone became
            icy. Canada must feel pain, he replied, so that the next time America
            asks an ally to act against China, that country will think twice.


            The rule of law with Chinese characteristics


            There are coherent arguments that China could make against Ms Meng’s detention,
            drawing on its dislike of extraterritorial sanctions and prosecutions
            by America. Instead, in explaining her case, officials mostly present
            a cynical view of the law as a tool by which power is exercised. The party
            line is that a jealous America tried to break Huawei as a high-tech champion
            but was stared down by a stronger China. No details are offered. If relations
            with the West are turbulent, that is because national rejuvenation is
            close at hand. To quote Xinhua, the state news agency, Ms Meng’s arrest
            was prompted by China’s rise and “so was her release!”


            Within China news is spreading of the Canadians’ deportation, ostensibly
            on health grounds. Propaganda chiefs see an interest in publicising a
            claim by the White House that Ms Meng’s release was decided by prosecutors
            without political interference and denying that she was swapped for two
            Canadians: a claim that netizens find risible. Guancha, a nationalist
            website, created a hashtag mocking the White House statement, inspiring
            social-media posts that have been read over 300m times. Anti-American
            glee is hard to reconcile with official half-denials that China takes
            hostages. China seems to sense a moment for fists, not gloves.'

        title: China believes that America is forging alliances to stop its rise
        text: 'F OR CHINESE leaders, the rows about AUKUS , a new security pact between
            America, Australia and Britain, confirm cherished prejudices about the
            Western world. China has always believed that America’s network of global
            alliances is a cover for hegemony, even if American leaders offer warm
            words about defending universal values, standing up for friends and opposing
            “attempts by stronger countries to dominate weaker ones”, as President
            Joe Biden did at the UN on September 21st.

            Chinese suspicions are, in this case, bolstered by French anger over AUKUS
            , which was born out of Australia’s decision to break a deal to buy diesel-electric
            submarines from France, in favour of buying nuclear-powered ones from
            America. When a French government minister accused Britain of returning
            to the American fold and “accepting a form of vassal status”, that was
            a vindication for China. Indeed, the Frenchman’s attack could be printed,
            without alteration, in the People’s Daily, a mouthpiece of China’s Communist
            Party. For all that, at least to date, the Chinese official response has
            been a study in caution, avoiding loud expressions of solidarity with
            France. That is revealing, because China normally praises French leaders
            when they call for Europe to pursue “strategic autonomy” in its foreign
            and security policies. Chinese diplomats know that France’s vision of
            autonomy is code for avoiding over-reliance on America.


            Instead, China has so far pursued narrower, rather technical lines of
            attack on AUKUS , related to the eight nuclear-propelled submarines that
            Australia is to buy from America. China’s ambassador to the International
            Atomic Energy Agency, a nuclear watchdog, accused America of undermining
            non-proliferation work by transferring nuclear know-how and weapons-grade
            uranium to Australia, saying this would make it harder to stop Iran and
            North Korea from seeking similar technologies. The foreign ministry in
            Beijing added some tut-tutting about countries forming small cliques.
            By the standards of recent America-bashing in China, such grumbles barely
            count as throat-clearing.


            After speaking to various wise owls in Beijing, both Chinese and foreign,
            Chaguan has explanations to offer. It is true that AUKUS confirms prejudices
            dear to Chinese officials and scholars. The first of these is that power
            is the driver of geopolitics, even if smaller countries talk of putting
            their faith in multinational co-operation, the rules-based order and other
            pretty phrases. If Australia would rather be America’s vassal than France’s
            partner, that merely confirms China’s bleak, might-makes-right worldview.
            That view is reflected in lectures that China delivers to envoys in Beijing.
            With tiresome regularity, it is the lot of Western ambassadors to be informed
            that, if their small or midsized home country has dared to challenge China,
            it can only be because their government is foolishly trying to please
            America, whose hand is behind all of China’s troubles.


            The AUKUS pact also reinforces a talking point that the Western world
            is far from united about China, especially when it comes to speaking out
            about questions of principle, such as the crushing of Hong Kong’s democratic
            opposition or the repression of Muslims in Xinjiang. These are mostly
            Anglo-Saxon obsessions, Chinese diplomats and scholars like to suggest.
            Alas, they sigh, Americans, the British and their friends in the Anglosphere
            think it is their birthright to run the world, like some gang of finger-wagging
            missionaries or sunburnt colonial administrators. Chinese officials praise
            leaders whom they see as more focused on business interests, such as Angela
            Merkel in Germany.


            Still, China has not hastened to woo France in its hour of wrath. For
            one thing, China may see a benefit in letting Western powers feud, uninterrupted.
            For another, France’s furious response is a bit undignified. In Chinese
            culture, a public tantrum may signal nao xiu cheng nu, or “from shame
            to rage”, meaning the specific form of high-decibel meltdown staged by
            someone facing humiliation. Ticking off reasons why France might be cross,
            a Chinese scholar lists the cancelled contract worth tens of billions
            of dollars, and a “loss of face” caused by Australia’s hint that French
            submarines are not capable enough to deter China.


            Nor is AUKUS hailed as a chance to divide the West. Wang Yiwei, director
            of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing,
            notes China’s relatively weak anti-submarine capabilities. “For Australia
            to have nuclear submarines is very dangerous for China,” he says. “They
            are not needed for Australia’s national defence. This is about China.”


            An arms race looms


            Chinese leaders have a double view of America. They remain exceedingly
            wary of American areas of strength, from its armed forces to its high
            technology. Chinese leaders can see for themselves America’s robust economic
            growth, compared with Europe or Japan. Yet they increasingly believe that
            Western societies are growing decadent. “The key competition between China
            and the US is about domestic governance,” explains Professor Wang, before
            listing America’s failings, from economic and racial inequalities to its
            handling of covid-19. “In the view of the Chinese ruling elite, US domestic
            governance is in serious trouble,” he says.'

        title: In the West, China holds growing sway over Chinese-language media
        text: 'I N 2019, AT a conference in China of Chinese-language media firms
            from around the world, a senior official deviated from his script to make
            his point clear. It was, he said, the “duty and mission” of such firms
            to help “retransmit” news from China’s state-controlled press at “important
            times”. But the more than 400 delegates from over 60 countries, including
            America, Australia, Britain and Canada, would have needed no reminding.
            Their presence itself was a sign that China had already succeeded in bringing
            much of the world’s Chinese-language media under its thumb. Widespread
            use of WeChat, a censored Chinese social-media platform, is helping it
            shut out those that are not.

            China’s main spending on propaganda abroad has been on the foreign-language
            news services of its state-controlled media. In recent years it has lavished
            billions of dollars on building a global television network aimed at rivalling
            the BBC and CNN , as well as on the overseas expansion of its newspapers.
            But it has also been working hard to boost its influence among media abroad
            that are not under the Communist Party’s direct command. Those that use
            the Chinese language are among its main targets. There are tens of millions
            of ethnic Chinese living outside the country. The party likes to think
            of them as potential defenders of its cause in an increasingly China-sceptical
            West.


            Chinese officials say there are more than 1,000 Chinese-language media
            outlets overseas. Some are newspapers that have long been partisan. Until
            the 1980s, the most widely circulated ones were run and owned by people
            from Hong Kong and Taiwan. They were staunchly anti-Communist. Those with
            Taiwanese connections were usually backed by the Kuomintang, the party
            that was toppled by the Communists in 1949 and took refuge on the island.
            During the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the party grew alarmed by
            widespread support within the diaspora for the pro-democracy demonstrators.
            It began stepping up efforts to bend Chinese-language media abroad to
            the party’s propaganda needs.


            The party was helped by dramatic changes within the global newspaper industry
            as a result of the spread of the internet and falling revenue from print
            advertising. Many cash-strapped Chinese-language outlets were delighted
            by offers of paid content from Chinese state media with which they could
            fill their pages. Owners of Chinese-language newspapers became all too
            willing to sell their stakes to tycoons with business interests in China,
            who were eager to show their loyalty to the party by regurgitating its
            propaganda.


            In some cases China’s own state-owned firms became big shareholders. The
            majority of Chinese-language news organisations outside China are now
            either directly or indirectly owned by the Chinese government, says Rose
            Luqiu of Hong Kong Baptist University. In February Sing Tao, a Hong Kong-based
            Chinese-language newspaper that is widely read in America, was bought
            by Kwok Hiu-ting, the daughter of a mainland-Chinese property developer.
            That prompted America to require the newspaper to register as a “foreign
            agent”, a designation that the Trump administration applied to several
            mainland-controlled media as a way of highlighting their ties with the
            Communist Party.


            China has also used heavier-handed methods. Journalists and editors who
            have family members in mainland China are sometimes warned either directly
            or through their relatives to write copy that pleases the party. Businesses
            are pressed not to place advertisements in Chinese-language outlets that
            criticise China. News organisations that try to remain independent struggle
            to recruit journalists because potential candidates fear retribution,
            says the founder of one such outlet. Such organisations are subject to
            cyber attacks. To avoid difficulties, many Chinese-language media practise
            self-censorship. Most of the big ones in America now read like the People’s
            Daily, the party’s official mouthpiece.


            Some still resist the party’s embrace. A handful are controlled by overseas-based
            practitioners of Falun Gong, a spiritual sect that the party banned in
            1999 and calls an “evil cult”. The website of New Tang Dynasty Television,
            or NTDTV , a Falun Gong-backed outfit, is more frequently visited in America
            than that of the official Chinese state broadcaster, according to Alexa,
            an internet research company. There are also services funded by Western
            governments, such as the BBC , Deutsche Welle, Voice of America and Radio
            Free Asia, that publish Chinese-language news online. Some international
            media have news websites in Chinese. Mandarin-speaking vloggers on YouTube
            broadcast political commentary that is critical of the Chinese government.
            Several of them have hundreds of thousands of subscribers.


            To the party, however, the most crucial subset of the diaspora is made
            up of the millions of people who were born in China and have gone abroad
            to work or study, or as émigrés. This group is still outnumbered by foreign-born
            ethnic Chinese, many of whom are the descendants of people who left China
            generations ago. But their ranks have been growing fast. China wants to
            ensure that they do not turn their backs on the party, not least because
            it fears their potential influence over friends and relatives in China
            itself.


            People in this group rely heavily on WeChat, a super-app that nearly everyone
            uses in China, to stay connected with people on the mainland and communicate
            with other China-born contacts abroad. In Australia, over 60% of Chinese-language
            news consumers say they read most of their news on WeChat, according to
            a survey by two academics in that country: Wanning Sun of the University
            of Technology Sydney and Haiqing Yu of RMIT University. WeChat has almost
            700,000 daily active users in Australia.


            Many Chinese newspapers increasingly rely on WeChat to reach new readers.
            To make that easier, they often censor themselves. In China, WeChat purges
            content that the party does not like. The international version of the
            app is less tightly controlled, but it is difficult for news organisations
            considered hostile by the party to set up public accounts on it to push
            their articles to users. In December the platform even deleted a post
            by Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, in which he said that Australia
            was a “free, democratic, liberal country”. He was criticising a Chinese
            diplomat’s Twitter post of a faked image of an Australian soldier killing
            a child in Afghanistan. WeChat said it had removed Mr Morrison’s message
            because it had used “misleading words” to “distort historical events and
            deceive the public”.


            In May China’s leader, Xi Jinping, called for a bigger push to explain
            to people abroad “why the Chinese Communist Party is capable, why Marxism
            works and why socialism with Chinese characteristics is good”. He has
            found willing assistants. '

        title: China pledges to stop financing coal plants abroad
        text: 'I N A SPEECH by video-link, Xi Jinping, China’s president, told the
            UN on September 21st that his country would stop supporting new coal-power
            projects overseas. Since 2013, 95% of the funding for coal-fired power
            plants that came from outside the countries where the plants are located
            has come from China, Japan and South Korea. In April South Korea vowed
            to end state-backed financing of coal plants abroad; in June Japan pledged
            to do the same. Climate campaigners are celebrating China’s decision to
            follow suit.

            By some estimates, 70% of all coal plants being built today rely to some
            degree on China’s cash. Cutting off this source will hobble the building
            and operation of such projects in poor countries, where demand for power
            is often difficult to meet without foreign help. But by mentioning only
            overseas coal, Mr Xi glossed over China’s own dependence on the stuff.
            Last year, the country’s power plants produced over half the world’s coal-generated
            electricity. It continued adding new coal-fired power capacity at a pace
            of roughly a new coal plant a week. China is already moving away from
            funding coal plants abroad anyway, mostly because of the falling price
            of renewable energy.


            However, the gesture is at least a sign that China does not want to be
            seen as a spoiler of global climate-change efforts. John Kerry, President
            Joe Biden’s climate envoy, had been urging China to make a pledge of this
            kind. But China had warned that climate-change co-operation with America
            could be jeopardised by tension in the two countries’ relationship. Now
            tongues are wagging about whether China might have more good news to announce
            at COP 26, the UN climate summit that is due to be held in Glasgow in
            November. (Mr Xi is unlikely to attend in person—since the pandemic began,
            he has shunned travel abroad.)


            The speculation mainly surrounds China’s plans for cutting emissions of
            greenhouse gases. The most tantalising possibility is that the country
            will move forward the date by which it aims for its carbon emissions to
            reach a peak: currently 2030. (A year ago, Mr Xi also said China would
            strive for “carbon neutrality”—a balance between carbon emissions and
            carbon reduction—by 2060). Given that China is the world’s largest emitter,
            an earlier peak could make a big difference to the world’s climate prospects,
            especially if it is followed by a marked decline.'

        title: China is becoming more assertive in international legal disputes
        text: 'I N EARLY JANUARY the Communist Party published a five-year plan for
            the development of “socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics”.
            Most of the document is domestically focused, but one section is devoted
            to foreign matters. It calls on China to help shape international law,
            to turn itself into the first choice of jurisdiction when resolving cross-border
            disputes and to encourage the use of Chinese law abroad.

            The party’s goal, the plan says, is to promote “fair and reasonable” international
            rules. But in the past year it has become increasingly clear that the
            party means to take a legal fight to the world. President Xi Jinping wants
            China’s legal apparatus to grow bolder when dealing with international
            matters, and to reshape international legal and regulatory norms. In areas
            such as patents, maritime rights, cyber-security, sanctions and extradition
            battles, the Communist Party is using its legal system to safeguard and
            advance China’s interests in ways it has not previously done.


            The most visible part of this push has been the party’s aggressive response
            to Western sanctions imposed for the repression of ethnic Uyghurs, a Muslim
            minority. China imposed retaliatory sanctions on Western officials and
            academics. It then authorised the seizure of assets and blocking of transactions
            made by firms complying with foreign sanctions. (In August the legislature
            delayed a vote on extending the same provision from mainland China to
            Hong Kong.)


            China is also advancing its conception of the rule of law—one that exists
            under the unquestioned leadership of the party—beyond its borders in other
            areas, such as intellectual property. At a Politburo meeting last November
            Mr Xi called for greater assertiveness in cross-border disputes, saying
            China should “promote the extraterritorial application” of its intellectual-property
            laws. Mr Xi was in effect “weaponising the judiciary” to defend China’s
            interests abroad, says Mark Cohen, a scholar of Chinese intellectual-property
            law at the University of California, Berkeley.


            In the past year Chinese courts have issued sweeping orders on behalf
            of Chinese smartphone-makers that seek to prevent lawsuits against them
            in other countries over the use of foreign companies’ intellectual property.
            The Chinese courts have ordered these “anti-suit injunctions” so that
            they (rather than foreign courts) can decide how much Chinese firms should
            pay in royalties to the holders of patents that their products use. Jorge
            Contreras at the University of Utah says this marks an unusual escalation
            in the use of judicial power globally.


            The assertion by China’s courts of a right to set global rates in patent
            disputes is not unprecedented; a British court did something similar in
            2017. But China’s courts have become much more activist than others in
            claiming this authority. The stakes are high. Chinese courts typically
            grant a fraction of what might be ordered by a Western court. And China
            typically has leverage over the foreign parties in these cases. Those
            that manufacture goods in China or sell to the Chinese market must heed
            such rulings or face big penalties.


            In the past year Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi have all won anti-suit injunctions
            against foreign patent-holders. Out-of-court agreements on royalty rates
            are typical in such cases. Experts say the Chinese injunctions helped
            Huawei and Xiaomi win better settlements, and may do the same for Oppo.


            Another focus for the courts has been the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI
            ), Mr Xi’s sprawling effort to finance and build physical and digital
            infrastructure all around the world. It has spawned numerous disputes
            between foreign entities and Chinese contractors and banks. China has
            set up a special international commercial court to resolve some disputes.
            In 2019 the Supreme People’s Court called for the strengthening of Chinese
            courts’ capacity to hear international commercial cases and for the improvement
            of arbitration, the better to settle such matters in China.


            Foreign experts say such cases would normally be handled in the country
            where the work was done. “It would be unbelievable for any foreign company
            that’s doing business in their country, not in China, to accept dispute
            resolution in China unless they’re politically coerced or economically
            coerced into doing it,” says Jerome Cohen of New York University.


            The party would argue that it has merely begun to take a more active role
            in shaping international law. China entered international treaties and
            bodies, such as the UN and the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ), under
            rules it had no hand in writing, after years during which the Communist
            Party was either hostile to such institutions or followed the advice of
            Deng Xiaoping, a former leader, to keep a low profile in international
            affairs. Mr Xi has shed that caution.


            Foreign companies have begun to note the willingness of the Chinese courts
            to claim more authority in matters beyond their borders. At least one,
            Samsung Electronics of South Korea, has tried to benefit from it. In December
            a court in Wuhan granted an injunction to Samsung, forbidding Ericsson,
            a Swedish telecoms firm, from going to any other court in the world to
            resolve a global dispute over the use of Ericsson’s patents in Samsung’s
            hardware. A judge in Texas, at Ericsson’s request, tried to rebuff the
            Chinese ruling with an “anti-interference order”, which some have called
            an “anti-anti-suit injunction”. The Texas judge ruled that Ericsson deserved
            a hearing in America on a royalty rate for use of its patents in the American
            market. But the Wuhan court had pre-emptively included an “anti-anti-anti-suit
            injunction” in its original ruling. Samsung and Ericsson agreed on a global
            settlement in May, the Wuhan court having strengthened Samsung’s negotiating
            position.


            Judges, officials and business people have bristled at the new aggressiveness
            of China’s courts. In July the European Union filed a request with the
            WTO that China be more transparent about such cases. Its rulings are often
            not made public, yet Chinese judicial authorities have tended to view
            these cases as important guideposts for future rulings. The office of
            the US Trade Representative has also registered concern about China’s
            use of anti-suit injunctions.


            Mr Xi might argue that the playing field has for too long been skewed
            against China. Mr Contreras says Chinese officials now see judicial assertiveness
            as an important new tool that can help tilt things in their direction.

        title: Protesters in China besiege an indebted property developer
        text: 'P ROTESTS BY ANGRY investors are common in China. Average folk who
            have been deceived by online lenders or other scam artists have few outlets
            for redress. They occupy office lobbies until a senior executive appears
            to calm their nerves. It is rare, however, for demonstrators to target
            well-known companies, and rarer still for connected protests to crop up
            all across the country. Events such as these have made Evergrande, a massive
            property developer on the brink of default, something of a spectacle in
            recent days.

            The company has debts of around $300bn, the most of any property group
            in the world. On September 13th its headquarters in the southern city
            of Shenzhen (pictured) were besieged by investors who were demanding that
            their money be returned. Similar scenes were witnessed at Evergrande offices
            in several other cities. In one video circulating online a woman yells
            into a loudspeaker, demanding answers from Evergrande staff. In another,
            an executive attempts to field questions in a cramped hallway, only to
            be shouted down by protesters.


            Since 2020 the Chinese government has sought to limit property developers’
            borrowing. Rule changes that are part of a wider campaign against indebtedness
            have nudged several real-estate groups into default, or to the cusp of
            it. That is where Evergrande, once thought too big to fail, now finds
            itself. The company has hired advisers to help it resolve its financial
            difficulties and warned on September 14th that it could default. Many
            analysts who follow the group say that such an outcome, followed by a
            restructuring, is beginning to look unavoidable.


            Many of the people who have been protesting have put cash into financial
            products managed by Evergrande. Others are suppliers and contractors owed
            payment for their work on projects that have stalled all across China.
            In recent weeks the company has tried to sell off some of its unfinished
            housing developments in order to pay down its debts. Some videos also
            purport to show frustrated employees berating their bosses (Evergrande
            has well over 100,000 staff).


            The single largest group of people fearing harm are homebuyers who have
            already paid for their flats. China’s property market has long relied
            on people coughing up before their homes are completed, in order to generate
            working capital for developers. Of Evergrande’s roughly $300bn in liabilities,
            about 1.3trn yuan ($200bn) is cash that customers have put down for homes
            that have yet to be finished, estimates Capital Economics, a research
            firm. That is equivalent to the value of 1.4m individual properties.


            Chinese authorities are adept at managing small protests, which they often
            refer to as “mass incidents”. When China’s 1trn-yuan peer-to-peer lending
            boom came to an end in 2018, tens of thousands of ordinary people turned
            up on the doorsteps of companies that had swallowed their savings instead
            of providing the promised returns. These incidents were diffuse. It was
            rare for more than 100 people to protest at any given site. But the problem
            became so acute in Hangzhou, a hub for online-lending firms, that the
            local government was eventually forced to convert two stadiums into venues
            that could receive complaints from aggrieved investors.


            Xi Jinping, China’s president, has vowed to narrow the yawning chasm that
            divides China’s haves from its have-nots. High house prices are a particular
            focus. It is not yet clear whether this campaign will send prices lower.
            But it could very well bring to an end two decades of unbridled increases.
            House-price growth in China’s four largest cities eased slightly in August,
            compared with the month before.


            Footage of indignant investors, suppliers and employees, which has been
            shared widely on local social media, underscores the risks that Mr Xi
            runs as he orders state regulators to curb speculation in housing and
            clamp down on market excesses in the name of greater income equality or,
            as he calls it, “common prosperity”. Then again, Mr Xi and his team may
            draw another moral from those angry smartphone videos: that too little
            state control is the greatest risk of all. '

        title: The Chinese Communist Party’s model emperor
        text: 'W HAT WITH his dozens of concubines, his obsession with collecting
            precious jade and his penchant for inscribing his own (not very good)
            poems onto ancient paintings, the Qianlong emperor makes an unlikely hero
            for the Communist Party of China, especially one led by Xi Jinping, a
            stern ascetic. Qianlong was a man of formidable intellect and will, whose
            long reign from 1736-95 marked a high point of the Qing dynasty. But he
            was also a conservative aristocrat, from his passion for genealogy to
            his love of bowhunting on horseback, an archaic pastime even then.

            Chaguan was surprised, then, to hear an official historian praise Qianlong
            in terms that would make a Politburo member blush. The scholar, Wang Xudong,
            heads the Palace Museum in Beijing, as the Forbidden City is formally
            known. During a government-organised press tour, Mr Wang described past
            emperors as hard-working statesmen who “wanted their empire to be stable
            and prosperous”. Unbidden, Mr Wang denied that the geomantic design of
            the Forbidden City, with a hill behind it and a river in front, is a form
            of superstition. Feng shui is a commonsense tradition, he argued: everyone
            wants shelter from the wind and sustaining water nearby. As for palace
            temples devoted to ancestor worship, “China is a country devoted to families,”
            he soothed, as if duty-bound to play down any contradiction between imperial
            wonders and modern-day rule by an atheist party. Your columnist asked
            about two wildly popular drama series set in Qianlong’s court, which were
            booted from state television channels in 2019 after official media grumbled
            about the “negative impact” of imperial sagas filled with poisonings,
            betrayals and extravagant living. Such so-called Qing dramas are “cultural
            pollution”, sniffed Mr Wang. Why can’t they show examples of good governance
            by the emperor, or that princes and princesses were diligent and studious,
            he asked? “Those are lessons that our children can learn.”


            Tributes to favoured emperors are not new. As the party replaced Maoist
            fervour with Chinese nationalism in the 1980s and 1990s, Qianlong was
            rehabilitated as a nation-builder. Through a mix of diplomacy, wars and
            campaigns to crush far-flung rebellions, Qianlong added vast territories
            to his empire, notably in Tibet and Xinjiang. His reign was declared a
            heyday of the Qing dynasty before—as textbooks put it—the empire declined
            into decadence, subjected China to a century of humiliations at the hands
            of foreign powers, and collapsed in 1912. Recalling past shames remains
            useful for official historians, who praise the party for making China
            strong at last. But accounts of late-Qing weakness are increasingly offset
            by tributes to earlier glories. Today’s party sees value in presenting
            itself as heir to a uniquely wise—and distinctively Chinese—civilisation
            that can be traced back 5,000 years. For Mr Wang, an official of vice-ministerial
            rank, the Forbidden City is proof, in timber and stone, of that cultural
            exceptionalism. “If you did not have 5,000 years of civilisation, you
            would not have socialism with Chinese characteristics,” he declared, calling
            the party “a loyal inheritor and protector” of that glorious past.


            On August 24th Mr Xi, the party’s supreme leader, visited a site dear
            to Qianlong, an imperial summer retreat at Chengde, in cool, wooded hills
            north of Beijing. Mr Xi toured Puning Temple, a Buddhist complex built
            in a mix of Tibetan and Han Chinese styles. That architecture celebrates
            Qianlong’s crushing of a revolt by Mongol nomads who practised Tibetan
            Buddhism. Inspecting Puning’s red-pillared halls, Mr Xi stressed one of
            his priorities, the need to “sinicise” religions, meaning to make them
            Chinese in orientation so that, in his words, they better conform to and
            serve the needs of a socialist society. Then Mr Xi explored a new exhibition
            at the Chengde Museum that praises Qianlong in language that could come
            straight from the People’s Daily. Museum signs explain that Qianlong “improved
            the Qing central government’s management of Tibet, quelled multiple bouts
            of conflict by separatists in Xinjiang, and further unified this multi-ethnic
            country”.


            Chaguan visited the museum a few days later. It presents Qianlong as the
            epitome of a virtuous, Chinese ruler, whether that meant honouring ancestral
            rites by holding autumn hunts, or introducing policies to “unify all ethnicities”.
            There are reproductions of his Mandarin-language calligraphy and images
            of him in Chinese imperial robes. In fact Qianlong was a member of the
            Manchu nationality, like all Qing emperors. The Qing won the throne by
            toppling a Chinese dynasty, the Ming. Qianlong intended his hunt to preserve
            the traditions of his martial, nomadic ancestors, calling it “the best
            way to train Manchus”. It was open to Manchu nobles and soldiers, and
            some Mongol allies. Like many sacred Qing institutions, the hunt was essentially
            closed to the Han, the majority Chinese nationality. Han Chinese lived
            as subjects in a Manchu-led empire, barred by law from marrying Manchus
            and often living in separate city districts.


            Rebranding the multi-ethnic Manchu empire as “China”


            Such ethnic divisions and hierarchies complicate boasts about 5,000 years
            of continuous Chinese civilisation. Official historians respond by claiming
            that the Qing so admired Han culture that they instantly assimilated into
            it, becoming the latest in an unbroken line of Chinese rulers. Manchu-language
            imperial archives make clear that is too neat: the Qing retained a hybrid
            identity.


            The exhibit in Chengde is a puzzle. Important enough to draw Mr Xi, it
            rests on easily debunked history. The solution lies in another wall sign,
            which praises Chengde as a monument to the Qing dynasty’s “historic feats”
            of “pacification and consolidation of the border regions”. Two intensely
            political ideas lurk in that scholarly statement. First, the term “consolidation”
            reflects the party’s claim that Tibet and Xinjiang have always been Chinese
            and so were reclaimed, not conquered, by the Qing. Second, to the security-obsessed
            hard men who run China, pacifying restive regions is a supremely patriotic
            act. That makes Qianlong a model worker. '

        title: China has become a laboratory for the regulation of digital technology
        text: 'W ITH FOREIGN competitors such as Facebook and Google blocked, domestic
            tech giants have for two decades dominated the Chinese market. The Communist
            Party has kept a firm grip on politics, but the tech firms have had considerable
            leeway in their business activities. “It was a Wild West within an authoritarian
            system,” says Martin Chorzempa of the Peterson Institute, an American
            think-tank.

            Now the Communist Party is reminding internet billionaires who is boss.
            President Xi Jinping has authorised an extraordinary crackdown. Last year
            the planned IPO of Ant Group, a giant internet finance company, was halted
            at the last moment. In July, two days after Didi, a ride-hailing firm,
            went public in New York, China’s internet regulator ordered it to stop
            signing up new users, and forced its apps off mobile stores. The city
            of Beijing on September 6th denied reports that it is considering taking
            Didi under state control.


            Video-game companies are being pushed into scanning their users’ faces
            to help enforce a ban on children playing online games for more than three
            hours a week. The crackdown has shifted the balance, says Mr Chorzempa.
            Now, “technocrats, who have been frustrated for years that companies ignore
            proper, sensible regulations, are empowered.”


            The party is pushing for more than superficial change. It is using a suite
            of new laws and regulations to force tech firms to alter both their behaviour
            and their products. The aim is to control what Chinese people see and
            do online. The new rules will require tech firms to write code for their
            platforms so that they promote content that the government likes, and
            inhibit what it does not. This is likely to be more efficient than the
            whack-a-mole approach of enforcing the party’s will case by case, and
            plausible at a scale that the labour-intensive approach of trying to control
            technological systems directly would not be.


            In the past month alone Chinese lawmakers have finalised at least four
            new laws and regulations which, as they go into effect over the next three
            months, will have the potential to reshape the Chinese internet. Technology
            regulations in other countries and regions, such as Europe’s General Data
            Protection Regulation ( GDPR ), mostly require companies to obtain their
            customers’ consent for the specific processing of their data. China’s
            new rules are much stricter and more wide-ranging. Tech firms will be
            expected to protect national security and public order, says Nicolas Bahmanyar,
            a data-privacy consultant with Leaf, a law firm in Beijing. “A little
            banner is not going to cut it,” he adds.


            A Personal Information Protection Law ( PIPL ), China’s first privacy
            law, comes into effect on November 1st. Years in the making, it is much
            shorter and less detailed than GDPR , which inspired it, laying out principles
            that are both broad and intentionally vague. Details and future reinterpretations
            are to be dealt with by regulations particular to certain industries or
            technologies. This, says Mr Bahmanyar, allows regulation to keep pace
            with fast-changing technology. It also gives the government leeway to
            enforce vague rules as it sees fit. Didi was hit by rules brought in to
            govern companies whose digital services are seen as critical infrastructure.
            These were rewritten to cover foreign listings just as the firm was attempting
            to go public.


            Not all new laws will worry investors as much as the ones used to clobber
            Didi. Some deal with problems that affect the West, too. One forthcoming
            set of regulations published in draft on August 27th by the Cyberspace
            Administration of China ( CAC ) looks to set the rules for the use of
            recommendation algorithms. This is the sort of software that companies
            like Amazon and Alibaba use to recommend products based on a customer’s
            shopping history, or that short-video apps like TikTok use to work out
            what viewers like in order to give them more of it.


            The draft regulations require, for instance, that companies expose the
            keywords with which they have labelled their users, and allow users to
            delete them. This, in principle, will mean that internet users in China
            will no longer be dogged by advertisements for the refrigerator that a
            recommendation algorithm has decided they might like to buy. Writing algorithms
            which lead users to “addiction or high-value consumption” would also be
            banned. Algorithms which dispatch workers, such as Didi’s driver-management
            system, must “ensure workers’ rights and interests”. The regulations read
            like an attempt to fix the problems griped about by consumers everywhere.


            They also require firms that deploy recommendation algorithms to “uphold
            mainstream values” and to “vigorously disseminate positive energy”. Such
            algorithms must not be used to “engage in activities harming national
            security” or to upset the economic or social order. As such, their aim
            seems to be to withhold algorithmic juice from any content that does not
            make the government look good.


            Kendra Schaefer of Trivium, a consultancy in Beijing, has written that
            the publication of these new algorithm regulations marks the moment when
            Chinese tech laws have gone beyond those in Europe (in America, only California
            has such rules).


            Data-protection experts say many of these changes will be beneficial.
            Chinese internet users are constantly assailed by spam messages and phone
            calls. An app developed by the ministry of public security, which promises
            to screen fraudulent calls and messages, has become one of the most downloaded
            in China since it was released in March. The Chinese press is full of
            stories about people’s personal data being stolen. In 2016 Xu Yuyu, a
            prospective student, died of a heart attack after transferring her life
            savings to fraudsters who used personal data purchased on the black market
            to trick her into thinking they represented her university.


            Protecting people from such predations will burnish the party’s reputation
            for standing up for the little guy. The new rules give citizens more rights
            against companies than people in any other country. But they give Chinese
            internet users precisely no privacy rights enforceable against the state.
            Indeed, says Sajai Singh of J. Sagar Associates, a law firm in Bangalore,
            the creation of a single common standard for the treatment of data in
            China will make it easier for the state to spy on citizens. Mr Chorzempa
            says rewriting the law to make firms rewrite software is a sea change.
            Once they start feeling they can intervene “at this level and granularity,
            what else will they do?” he asks. '

        title: A provocative blog post stirs up a firestorm in China
        text: 'U NTIL RECENTLY Li Guangman, the retired editor of an obscure state-owned
            newspaper who writes leftist screeds online for a few fellow travellers,
            was unknown to the general public. That changed on August 29th, when the
            country’s biggest state and party media outlets circulated an incendiary
            blog post by Mr Li to their huge audiences, causing many to assume his
            views had official support. This prompted such a stir that a prominent
            state-media figure—Hu Xijin, editor of Global Times, a jingoistic party
            tabloid—felt compelled to post a scathing rebuttal.

            The episode may have offered a rare glimpse of uncertainty in elite party
            circles about what exactly President Xi Jinping wants. A year before he
            is expected to claim a third five-year term as party secretary, Mr Xi
            is undertaking a populist campaign against inequality, under the slogan
            “common prosperity for all”. It is unclear how far he intends to take
            it.


            Mr Li hopes very far. Writing under the title “Everyone can feel that
            a profound change is taking place!”, his article relished recent crackdowns
            on big business, celebrities and the super-rich. He suggested it was only
            the beginning of an anti-capitalist, anti-Western campaign that would
            bring the Communist Party back to its socialist roots. The country was
            experiencing a moment of “profound revolution”, he wrote. The “red” would
            soon return and China would no longer be “a paradise for capitalists to
            get rich overnight” nor “a paradise for effeminate men”.


            But Mr Li’s views were too radical even for an establishment populist
            firebrand like Mr Hu. On September 2nd he wrote a blog post disputing
            that a “revolution” is at hand, and, in a veiled reference to the excesses
            of the disastrous Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, called the rhetoric
            inflammatory. “I am worried that such language will stir up some historical
            memories,” triggering “confusion and panic”, he wrote. Both posts are
            still accessible online.


            It is highly unusual for state media to promote the rants of obscure bloggers.
            “He’s a nobody,” says Jude Blanchette of CSIS , a think-tank, and author
            of “China’s New Red Guards”, a book about neo-Maoists. And Mr Hu’s rebuke
            of an officially blessed essay was no less rare. What does it all mean?


            One commentator with a large following among government officials argues
            it does not mean much. Ren Yi, whose pen name is Chairman Rabbit, says
            he believes the initial promotion of Mr Li’s post was “an accident”, and
            that no senior leaders were pushing it. “Now you are seeing officials
            doing a lot to calm people down,” says Mr Ren, adding that he was “disgusted”
            by the piece’s anti-capitalist language. On September 2nd Mr Xi gave a
            speech announcing a new stock exchange in Beijing to support small business.
            Four days later Liu He, an economic adviser to Mr Xi, said the private
            sector was an essential part of the economy and should be given “vigorous”
            support.


            The targets of Mr Xi’s crackdowns might not be so easily comforted. Consider
            what happened in August. A party commission meditated on Mr Xi’s desire
            to achieve shared prosperity for all, and resolved that the rich would
            have to pay more. Tencent, a tech giant, promptly pledged $7.7bn to social
            programmes. Zheng Shuang, a famous actress, was fined $46m for tax evasion.
            The Supreme People’s Court declared illegal the 72-hour work week, a fixture
            in China’s gig economy.


            Mr Xi is walking a fine line, needing to show he understands popular anger
            about inequality without scaring the horses in the new economy. Mr Blanchette
            sees the debate as a reflection of uncertainty within the establishment
            about the intensity of Mr Xi’s campaign.


            State interventions are immensely popular with leftists like Mr Li, and
            he has received plenty of online support. One blogger, writing under the
            pen name “Little Z, a citizen observer”, concluded that Mr Li was “too
            radical” and Mr Hu “too conservative”. But Little Z mostly supported Mr
            Li. The “thunderbolt” of recent regulatory actions was an “exciting” harbinger
            of further coercive measures to reduce the wealth gap, he wrote. “This
            is only the prologue.” '

        title: A new book looks behind Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign
        text: 'T HE CALL from China came in the early morning. Desmond Shum, a former
            tycoon now living in the West, heard the voice of his ex-wife, Duan Weihong,
            for the first time in four years. Ms Duan vanished in Beijing in September
            2017, shortly after Communist Party anti-corruption investigators came
            for a patron of hers, a young member of the Politburo once seen as a successor
            to the supreme leader, President Xi Jinping.

            The call from Ms Duan, who also used the English name Whitney, was followed
            quickly by a second. Both contained a warning. She urged her ex-husband
            to halt the publication, on September 7th, of a book he has written about
            their joint career as entrepreneurs in the 1990s and 2000s. That was a
            gilded age of breakneck growth and influence-peddling that, Mr Shum alleges,
            vastly enriched both the couple and their business partners, including
            family members of senior leaders within the Communist Party. “No good
            comes to those who oppose the state,” Ms Duan told her ex-husband, saying
            that she was on a provisional form of release but faced renewed detention
            at any time. She begged him to consider the welfare of their 12-year-old
            son, who lives with Mr Shum.


            He published anyway. “I don’t know whether I was talking to her, or to
            her handlers,” Mr Shum says in a telephone interview. “She told me herself
            that she has had no contact with the outside world for the past four years.”
            Weighing this attempt at intimidation, he is unsure whether the party
            knew what was in his book, or simply feared “who I am and what I know”.


            The machine was right to be worried. Large scandals of the recent past
            are revisited in “Red Roulette: An Insider’s Story of Wealth, Power, Corruption
            and Vengeance in Today’s China”, including allegations that the family
            of Wen Jiabao, then the prime minister, amassed vast fortunes by facilitating
            business deals and taking stakes in state-owned firms on strikingly generous
            terms. Some of those deals were brokered by Mr Shum and his ex-wife, though
            he denies law-breaking. Small, grubby details of elite life in the book
            are just as revealing, for they challenge one of the party’s main claims
            to legitimacy, namely that its monopoly on power helps to explain China’s
            modern-day rise.


            In the party’s telling, its autocracy is a merit-based system run by technocrats
            who are free to take the long view and act for the common good, rather
            than worrying about the next election. Mr Shum describes the reality.
            To build a new airport cargo terminal, he spent three years collecting
            150 official seals from sundry agencies and ministries, many of them locked
            in paralysing competition with one another. That quest involved, at various
            points, arranging heart-bypass surgery for a local official who collapsed
            during a junket to Las Vegas and California, and building airport-customs
            officers a new complex, complete with tennis courts and a 200-seat theatre.


            Mr Shum names the hotel in Beijing where, on any given night, three or
            four government ministers were hosted by entrepreneurs eager to buy their
            favour, in a labyrinth of private dining rooms designed to keep different
            groups from spotting each other. His book turns a jaundiced, insider’s
            eye on claims that, in the absence of a free press, independent judiciary
            and other checks and balances, officials are held to account by internal
            targets. Explaining the purging of a big airports boss, Mr Shum concedes
            that the official’s gambling habit made him vulnerable, but insists that
            his cardinal error was to exceed revenue targets by such a margin that
            rival bureaucrats craved his job.


            In some aspects, Mr Shum’s book supports Mr Xi’s diagnosis of China’s
            ills. It describes sleaze that largely predates Mr Xi’s elevation as party
            chief in 2012. Since then, the Xi era has witnessed an anti-corruption
            drive that has seen more than 1.5m officials punished. Mr Xi himself grumbles
            about foot-dragging officials who put parochial interests first.


            Still, leaders have grounds to dislike the book. It argues that Mr Xi’s
            anti-corruption drive is as much a campaign to consolidate power as a
            sincere attempt to reform a rotten system. The campaign has spared some
            notoriously corrupt princelings, the children or grandchildren of high
            officials. A self-made man, Mr Shum calls red aristocrats a “separate
            species”, reared in high-walled compounds, sent to special schools and
            fattened on food supplies reserved for senior leaders.


            They even enjoy special forms of corruption, he notes. Rather than hustle
            to build real businesses, he describes princelings seeking lucrative monopoly
            contracts from the state. Most damningly, he charges that the well-born
            are shielded during anti-corruption probes, in part because they know
            to obey what he calls the party’s Mafia-like code of silence. He asserts
            that Li Peiying, the airports boss, was executed after talking too much
            about high-level corruption, while in the same year a party elder’s son
            was only jailed for taking larger bribes. “Red aristocrats got a prison
            sentence; commoners got a bullet in the head,” he writes.


            Now you’ve crossed the line


            With that charge, the book challenges a second form of legitimacy that
            is dear to Mr Xi, himself the son of a high-ranking official. Mr Xi asks
            the masses to have faith in the party, not just because China is more
            prosperous, but because it carries “red genes” inherited from revolutionary
            pioneers and martyrs, and has always put the people first. In a speech
            on July 1st Mr Xi declared: “The party has no special interests of its
            own—it has never represented any individual interest group, power group,
            or privileged stratum.”


            “Red Roulette” undercuts that claim. It describes red aristocrats demanding
            30% stakes in business deals merely for being seen to be supportive. It
            details an elite China built on secrets and fear, in which family ties
            are one of the only reliable bonds of trust. Mr Xi would have people believe
            that corruption is an external infection. Insiders know that it is in
            the party’s blood. '

        title: China’s bid to stabilise its property market is causing jitters
        text: 'O CTOBER 6TH 1979 was a beautiful Saturday in Washington. It was not
            the kind of day that augured wrenching change in economic policy. But
            on that date Paul Volcker, then chairman of America’s central bank, announced
            a radical plan to quash persistent inflation. Before the battle was won,
            America’s interest rates reached 20% and unemployment surpassed 10%. Car

            China is now facing its own “Volcker moment”, according to Ting Lu of
            Nomura, a bank. The government’s aim is not to curb an inflationary spiral
            (China’s consumer prices are rising only modestly) but to break a vicious
            circle of property speculation and credit expansion. Regulators are making
            it harder for developers to raise money and for households to buy homes.
            The new rules have already pushed several property firms, including the
            country’s biggest homebuilder, Evergrande, to the brink and contributed
            to a decline in home sales. But are China’s rulers willing to endure anything
            like the economic discomfort that Volcker inflicted to achieve their goals?
            The world may be about to find out.


            An Englishman’s home is his castle. In China, a home is much more besides.
            As well as providing shelter and security, housing often serves as collateral,
            nest-egg, speculative investment, bride-price and ticket to a good school.
            Housing makes up three-quarters of household wealth, according to the
            China Household Financial Survey, a data set compiled by academics in
            China. It accounts for the biggest chunk of household debt, which by one
            estimate exceeded 70% of GDP at the end of last year. Local governments
            raise 30% of their revenue by selling land to developers. And policymakers
            often rely on homebuilding to revive the economy in downturns.


            Property dons other guises, too. The high price of housing is often likened
            to a “big mountain” (alongside costly health care and education) and a
            “grey rhino” (an obvious but neglected risk). In March Guo Shuqing, the
            head of China’s banking and insurance regulator, warned that if house
            prices were to drop, people holding multiple properties would not only
            suffer “huge losses”, they might also fall delinquent on their mortgages,
            endangering the banks and leading to “economic chaos”.


            The government wants property to play a more modest role. In December
            2016 President Xi Jinping said homes were for “living in, not for speculating”,
            a phrase that officials now often repeat. In 2019 the Communist Party
            declared that property was not a tool for short-term economic stimulus,
            a commitment reiterated at a meeting of the ruling Politburo in July.


            The authorities are facing the grey rhino more squarely by trying to tackle
            the industry’s financial fragilities. Last year regulators capped the
            share of mortgages and property-related loans that banks may hold. They
            also imposed “three red lines” on prominent property developers, limiting
            the size of their debts relative to their assets, equity and cash. Now
            when the president of Country Garden, a high-end developer, talks of his
            aim to “turn green” he is not referring to the environment, but to keeping
            clear of those lines.


            The impact of the curbs on the property market is becoming more stark.
            Sales of new homes in 30 cities tracked by Wind, a financial-data firm,
            fell by 23% in August compared with a year earlier, having fallen less
            sharply in July and June. Sales were also lower than in the same period
            of 2019, before the pandemic (see chart). Nomura’s Mr Lu says investors
            should prepare for a “much worse-than-expected growth slowdown, more loan
            and bond defaults, and potential stockmarket turmoil.” Will the regulators
            blink? In the past, policymakers have been quick to ease property curbs
            in downturns. A big drop in house sales or prices over several months
            would probably “jolt the government into a more dovish stance”, argues
            Rosealea Yao of Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy. But Mr Lu believes
            it will be hard for leaders to reverse course. They have publicly committed
            themselves to a tighter policy and created bureaucratic momentum behind
            it. Earlier this year the central government sacked officials in the southern
            city of Shenzhen for failing to tame prices. The curbs can be seen as
            part of the government’s new preoccupation with creating “common prosperity”.
            Unaffordable housing conflicts with this aim. Research by three Chinese
            academics—Guanghua Wan, Chen Wang and Yu Wu—has found that the cost of
            housing causes about 75% of China’s wealth inequality. It may also be
            one reason why China’s families now have so few children, a trend that
            increasingly worries the government. To shore up growth, China may try
            building more subsidised homes. It has ordered 40 cities to construct
            almost 1m low-rent housing units this year. But it will take time to ramp
            up such work on a sufficient scale. Meanwhile, China’s growth will face
            other threats. Service industries may suffer from pandemic-related lockdowns.
            Exports may grow more slowly as manufacturing recovers abroad. And infrastructure
            spending will weaken if local governments cannot sell as much land to
            developers.


            It is hard to imagine China pushing things nearly as far as Volcker did.
            But then Volcker himself did not foresee the full economic pain that would
            follow that beautiful Saturday. China’s hard-pressed developers may find
            themselves with many unsold properties in the months ahead. Where will
            they send the keys? '

        title: America wants China to end support for coal projects abroad
        text: 'S INCE JOE BIDEN became America’s president in January, few senior
            American officials have visited China. But as The Economist went to press,
            Mr Biden’s special envoy for climate change, John Kerry, was in the middle
            of his second trip this year. With relations so rancorous in almost every
            other domain, the two countries appear to welcome the chance to talk about
            a problem they hope can be tackled together. There may be political dividends
            for both.

            Mr Kerry has set his sights on coal, a big contributor to global warming.
            China is not only the world’s biggest producer and consumer of it, but
            has also been a leading financer of coal-fired power plants in developing
            countries. During his talks with Chinese officials in the northern city
            of Tianjin, which began on September 1st and were due to end on September
            3rd, Mr Kerry was expected to urge China to cease its involvement in such
            projects abroad.


            At first glance, Mr Kerry’s request may seem odd. Until 2019 China’s support
            for coal-fired energy was a big part of its Belt and Road Initiative (
            BRI ), a global infrastructure-building scheme. But the picture has been
            changing fast. In 2019 and 2020 Chinese-backed coal projects abroad worth
            about $47bn were suspended or terminated. In the first half of 2021 China
            financed no new coal plants in countries involved in the BRI . This had
            little to do with global warming. Shuang Liu of the World Resources Institute,
            a think-tank in Washington, reckons that coal is no longer competitive
            in BRI countries due to a plunge in the price of renewable energy.


            The elephant in the room is China’s burning of coal at home. The country’s
            power plants last year produced over half of the world’s coal-generated
            electricity. Despite China’s professed concern about the climate, the
            share is about to get bigger. In 2020 China built more than three times
            as much new coal-fired power capacity as the rest of the world combined,
            at a pace of roughly a new coal plant a week. Taking account of the decommissioning
            of plants, the country’s capacity rose by a net 30 gigawatts in 2020,
            whereas the rest of the world’s saw a net decline of 17 GW .


            Look closer, though, and Mr Kerry’s focus on China’s global involvement
            in coal becomes easier to explain. Consider American politics. To people
            at home, the gentlemanly American envoy wants to appear tough on China—there
            is seething bipartisan animosity towards the country. A headline in the
            Wall Street Journal on the eve of Mr Kerry’s trip, “Kerry to press China
            to stop financing coal-fired energy projects,” captured the desired pose.
            Bashing China’s domestic addiction to coal would also smack of hypocrisy:
            America still gets over a fifth of its power from the stuff. Joe Manchin,
            a Democratic senator from West Virginia whose backing is vitally important
            to Mr Biden, is an unabashed supporter of coal. China has sent mixed signals
            about its own use of it. But despite its prodigious building of new carbon-spewing
            plants, it has pledged that its CO 2 emissions from coal will stop rising
            after 2025 and that China’s overall emissions of the gas will peak by
            2030. Mr Kerry is right to worry about China’s activities abroad. In recent
            months, America, Japan and South Korea have followed an example set by
            the European Union and Britain by ending official financing of overseas
            coal projects. But China has not yet issued such a ban to its own banks
            and development institutions. As a result, observes Leo Roberts of E 3
            G , a British environmental think-tank, “China is the public lender of
            last resort to an increasingly stigmatised industry.” The British organisers
            of a UN climate summit in Glasgow later this year hope it will help “consign
            coal power to history”. Given that new coal plants in most countries have
            bleak commercial prospects anyway, China may make a show of ending support
            for them abroad. That would be welcomed. But the real test of China’s
            dedication to fighting climate change will be what it does about the ones
            at home.

        title: Xi Jinping Thought, for children
        text: 'A SK MEMBERS of China’s elite—from senior officials to academics at
            leading universities, well-known commentators or bosses at big companies—to
            explain the beliefs of the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, and their replies
            are surprisingly unhelpful. Even simple questions elicit waffly answers.
            Take an ongoing campaign to clip the wings of some of China’s largest
            firms, notably technology giants. The authorities have variously accused
            such businesses of seeking excessive profits, harming national security
            with a cavalier approach to data, abusing workers, bullying smaller firms
            or exploiting young consumers with addictive video games and online fan
            clubs. Is Mr Xi revealing himself as an ideologue, bent on re-imposing
            Communist Party control over the economy at the expense of growth? Or
            is he more pragmatic than that: a nationalist strongman who is helping
            to make China stable at home and mighty abroad? There is chatter among
            the country’s grandees, but no consensus.

            Given such confusion among grown-ups, this is a bold moment to issue a
            new series of textbooks to all students in Chinese schools, colleges and
            universities, with the aim of explaining Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism
            with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era, as Mr Xi’s political philosophy
            is formally known.


            As the academic year began on September 1st, teachers and lecturers began
            distributing these books, tailored for each age-group, down to children
            as young as six. The use of stand-alone schoolbooks devoted to a serving
            leader marks a break with decades of caution. The last time that hundreds
            of millions of youngsters clutched books devoted to the wisdom of one
            man was under Mao Zedong, the object (and instigator) of a disastrous
            personality cult.


            Books for the young are especially revealing, for they have to keep their
            messages simple. Primary schools have long taught the general rudiments
            of ideology. Via courses with names like “ethics and law”, children have
            studied good deeds by the party’s founders and modern-day leaders. They
            have contemplated the magnificence of the motherland (helped by copious
            images of wind farms and border-marker stones). Textbooks have devoted
            many pages to wholesome lessons about honesty, friendship, the importance
            of hand-washing and respect for elders.


            The latest books for primary schools are still wholesome. But they are
            more focused on defining citizenship as a relationship with the party
            and its leader. Official guides for teachers concede that it is challenging
            for very young students to grasp abstract concepts. As a result, the new
            textbooks will use “golden” maxims from Mr Xi, as well as vivid stories
            and emotional experiences to “plant the seeds of love for the party, love
            for the nation and love for socialism in their little hearts”. A notice
            issued in late August by the education ministry’s National Textbook Committee
            sets out further aims. Youngsters should be guided to understand that
            Mr Xi is the leader of the whole party and country, it says. They must
            also resolve to obey and follow the party from their earliest years.


            In addition to praising conformity, the new books offer homely warnings
            about those who fail to fit in. The last chapter of the new textbook for
            six- to eight-year-olds opens with an injunction to “Button the First
            Button of Life Correctly”. Mr Xi often uses this phrase in speeches to
            the young. It refers to what he calls the duty of schools and families
            “to teach the first lessons of life well”, so that children do not end
            up out of line with their peers, like a misbuttoned coat that will have
            to be adjusted later.


            Another lesson in the book tells children about “Grandpa Xi’s expectations
            of us”. Alongside images of Mr Xi with members of the Young Pioneers,
            a party organisation for children aged between six and 14, it informs
            pupils: “As paramount leader of the party and state, Grandpa Xi Jinping
            has always cared for us, and wishes for us to strive to grow into worthy
            builders and inheritors of socialism.” In practice, teachers of politics
            and ideology—who form a highly trained elite, and a pool for future school
            heads—are encouraged to leaven this stodge with singing contests or lessons
            in patriotism based on news stories. Teachers say that instructive recent
            events include last year’s border clash between Chinese and Indian troops,
            and the American export bans on components needed by Huawei, a Chinese
            electronics giant.


            Power is the point


            At first glance these textbooks for small children, filled with Mr Xi’s
            quotes about caring for the environment, and with songs such as “I Love
            You, China”, (sample lyrics: “I love your boundless forest, I love your
            towering mountains”) may not seem to settle hard questions about the country’s
            ruling philosophy. Arguably, though, Chinese youngsters are getting something
            close to the true essence of Xi Jinping Thought. The overall aim of this
            reform, the textbook committee explains, is for the school and university
            curriculum to “comprehensively introduce” Mr Xi’s views on economics,
            politics, the rule of law, science and technology, culture, education,
            ethnic policies, religion, national defence, ecological civilisation,
            party-building and diplomacy, among other subjects. Put more concisely,
            Mr Xi is to be seen as the undisputed authority on everything.


            This is not the same as a Maoist personality cult. Mao encouraged the
            young to attack their teachers. He egged on fanatical Red Guards as they
            destroyed ancient temples. He wanted followers to attack a party establishment
            whose revolutionary fervour and loyalty he had come to doubt. In contrast,
            Mr Xi wants the young to study diligently, to take regular exercise and
            to listen to teachers talk about 5,000 years of glorious Chinese culture.
            Mr Xi is the establishment: the supreme incarnation of party authority.
            The party’s legitimacy, in turn, rests on its claims to unrivalled competence
            and success. It is not for ordinary citizens to second-guess or debate
            what Mr Xi personally believes. Like children heeding a teacher or an
            elder, it is their role to obey. '

        title: Research centres promoting Xi Jinping’s ideas are proliferating
        text: 'C HINA’S PRESIDENT , Xi Jinping, is hardly ever grilled in public about
            what he thinks. The few interviews he has given have been highly staged.
            But his propagandists have been building a network of institutes devoted
            to studying his thoughts. In June one was established to research “Xi
            Jinping thought on the rule of law”. The following month, two others were
            founded to analyse, respectively, his pronouncements on economics and
            green development. It is the biggest mobilisation of academic effort to
            parse the speeches of a serving leader since the era of Mao Zedong.

            China now has 18 Xi-thought research centres. Many of them focus on a
            particular topic such as politics, culture, science, education, religion,
            diplomacy or national security. Mr Xi’s ideas about these matters make
            up what is officially known as “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese
            Characteristics for the New Era”. The Communist Party adopted this as
            one of its guiding philosophies at a five-yearly congress in 2017. The
            first study centres were opened soon afterwards.


            They enjoy high political status. Some of their directors are senior party
            officials. The new one devoted to the economy is embedded within the National
            Development and Reform Commission, the government’s planning agency. It
            will be “an important think-tank”, according to state media. For much
            of the post-Mao period, the prime minister has overseen economic policy.
            Not so under Mr Xi. He has, in effect, sidelined the current prime minister,
            Li Keqiang, who has a P h D in economics.


            The new rule-of-law centre is run by the China Law Society, an official
            club of legal experts. One of Mr Xi’s main messages on this subject is
            that the party leads the judiciary and that notions such as the separation
            of powers or judicial independence are Western-inspired heresies. In a
            speech in December China’s domestic-security chief, Guo Shengkun, used
            the phrase “Xi Jinping thought on the rule of law” 27 times. The Education
            Ministry’s centre is studying the promotion of Mr Xi’s thoughts in schools.


            The recent flurry of Xi-centre openings may reflect an attempt to boost
            his already enormous profile ahead of the next party congress, which is
            due to be held late next year. It will be a crucial one. In 2018, not
            long after the latest congress, the country’s rubber-stamp parliament
            scrapped the state presidency’s ten-year term limit. The move fuelled
            speculation that Mr Xi planned to remain as China’s leader for at least
            another five years beyond 2022 (he also serves as party chief, a far more
            important role for which there has never been a term limit, but the two
            jobs have usually been held concurrently). In the coming months, officials
            are likely to build a case for Mr Xi’s continued rule. The centres will
            play their part.


            Keep it short


            Analysts will watch for signs that the cumbersome 16-character phrase
            used to describe Mr Xi’s thinking is being modified to put him on a par
            with Mao (who ruled until he died). Mr Xi has already surpassed his other
            predecessors. The thinking of two of them, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin,
            is also enshrined in the party charter but without their names attached.
            Deng Xiaoping is mentioned by name, but his thoughts are merely described
            as a “theory”. The only Chinese leader with a snappily named philosophy
            is Mao: his is known simply as Mao Zedong Thought. Were Mr Xi’s to be
            abbreviated in the same way, it would be yet another indication that his
            grip on power is unlikely to wane next year. Few people believe it will
            decline.


            Mr Xi’s ideas are so wide-ranging and often so vague that they defy ready
            definition (although the idea that the party must control everything,
            including academia, permeates his speeches). But those with questions
            may turn to the party’s main newspaper, the People’s Daily. It is halfway
            through a serialisation of a book published in February titled “Xi Jinping
            Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era: Questions
            and Answers for Learners”. Each day it prominently publishes a couple
            of new ones. Despite its connections, the newspaper appears not to have
            persuaded the man himself to explain. '

        text: 'C HINA HAS an anger-management problem, at least when dealing with
            small and mid-size Western democracies. The fate of Lithuania, a European
            Union member on the shores of the Baltic Sea, is a case in point.

            The country is being punished for agreeing that Taiwan, a democratic island
            that China claims as its own territory, may open a “Taiwanese Representative
            Office” in Vilnius, Lithuania’s capital. China calls that an affront to
            its sovereignty. It has summoned its ambassador, Shen Zhifei, home for
            consultations, and told Lithuania to recall its envoy, Diana Mickeviciene.
            In a covid-era twist, China informed Ms Mickeviciene of her fate as she
            returned to Beijing from a summer break. She has to complete three weeks
            of strict quarantine at her residence and, after emerging on August 31st,
            catch the next flight home. State media suggest that China may soon suspend
            direct rail-freight services to Lithuania, then sever other economic links
            with that country of 2.8m people (Lithuanian farmers should forget long-held
            dreams of selling milk to China, it is hinted). In a detail noted with
            dismay by foreign envoys in Beijing, Lithuania’s embassy has received
            a barrage of threatening calls, many targeting local Chinese staff.


            China’s problem is not simply that it has a short fuse. It is not new
            for leaders in Beijing to downgrade relations with governments that cross
            their “red lines”. China routinely freezes trade talks and official visits
            whenever foreign leaders meet Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai
            Lama (Lithuania suffered this fate in 2013). Last year China curbed imports
            of coal and wine from Australia after that country’s government called
            for an international probe into covid-19’s origins. Often, China’s demands
            are arcane as well as aggressive. Lithuania may earn a partial reprieve
            if it permits only a “Taipei Representative Office” in Vilnius. China
            tolerates trade offices named after Taiwan’s capital, because those sound
            like local government outposts. Even the hair-trigger anger of the Chinese
            public—or at least its noisiest elements—is wearily familiar. Each week,
            it seems, online nationalists demand a new domestic boycott of a business,
            or the cancellation of a foreign or local celebrity accused of hurting
            Chinese pride. Threats directed at Chinese deemed “race traitors” are
            alarmingly common.


            Rather, Chinese irascibility may prove more problematic than before because
            China’s ambitions are changing. The country no longer inhabits a world
            of bilateral ties dominated by trade, of the sort that allowed it to play
            one country off against another. It hopes to create new international
            networks and groupings that share similar views about what constitutes
            good governance, in which China plays the central role. That brings new
            forms of scrutiny when it loses its temper.


            About a decade ago, lots of foreign countries saw China as a dazzling,
            potentially transformative economic partner. Lithuania was no exception.
            In competition with Estonia and Latvia, its Baltic neighbours, it pitched
            its largest airport as a hub for Chinese flights, and its main seaport,
            Klaipeda, as an entry-point for Chinese ships. More recently, it sought
            to be a European gateway for Chinese financial technologies. In 2012 Lithuania
            joined 15 other central and eastern European countries, nine of them EU
            members, in a Chinese-led grouping. This came to be known as the “16 plus
            one” initiative, holding annual summits with China’s prime minister and
            spawning countless committees to work on co-operation. At first, many
            in eastern Europe chafed when the group was called a threat to the EU
            ’s unity by the continent’s rich Westerners. Easterners particularly resented
            being chided by Germany, given that country’s exceptional access to Chinese
            leaders and markets.


            Disappointment followed. Chinese investments in central and eastern Europe
            proved paltry, and the lion’s share went to Hungary, the Czech Republic,
            Poland and Serbia. Trade increased, but mostly because of imports from
            China. Today, China is still only Lithuania’s 12th-largest trade partner.
            As dreams of an economic bonanza faded, some members of the 16 plus one
            (which swelled to 17 after Greece joined in 2019) began comparing notes
            about the bloc’s political aims and lack of transparency. Like-minded
            embassies discovered that Chinese officials and party bodies were making
            direct contacts with regions, cities and institutions in their home countries,
            bypassing national capitals. In February six members—Bulgaria, Estonia,
            Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovenia—sent only ministers to a virtual
            summit of the 17 plus one, though President Xi Jinping was in the chair.


            China’s brand of performative patriotism goes global


            Further complicating China’s image, its nationalist fervour is increasingly
            on display far from home. In August 2019 Lithuania accused China’s embassy
            in Vilnius of rallying Chinese citizens to disrupt a protest in support
            of Hong Kong’s democrats (Chinese diplomats were photographed handing
            out banners). A few months later Chinese-speaking visitors proudly filmed
            themselves vandalising signs of support for Hong Kong planted on the Hill
            of Crosses, a shrine to national independence dating to Lithuania’s occupation
            by Nazi Germany and then by the Soviet Union. The videos went viral, appalling
            Lithuanians. In April this year expansion of Klaipeda’s outer harbour
            was put on hold for at least a decade. Senior officials had earlier called
            China’s attempts to invest in the port a national-security risk. In May
            Lithuania’s foreign minister announced his country’s withdrawal from the
            17 plus one, calling it divisive and less efficient than a unified EU
            .


            State media accuse Lithuania of foolishly provoking China in order to
            curry favour with America, as if smaller countries lack any will of their
            own. The mood of gloom and wariness among many European embassies in Beijing
            is obvious to all. But domestic political imperatives require outsize
            displays of anger, whenever China feels disrespected. That is a clumsy
            way to manage foreigners. To China, however, being defied is worse. '

        title: China is happy to see America humbled in Afghanistan
        text: 'O N THE AFTERNOON of August 17th, as scenes of horror unfolded around
            Kabul, China’s envoy to Afghanistan recorded the tranquil mood at his
            own embassy. The ambassador’s smartphone images, proudly shared on social
            media by Hu Xijin, the editor of a Communist Party tabloid, show the Chinese
            flag snapping crisply against a summer sky, and front doors guarded by
            nothing more menacing than a tall porcelain vase.

            China’s propaganda machine is enjoying the fall of Afghanistan, at least
            for now. Chinese diplomats and state media have missed no chance to contrast
            the chaotic retreat of America and its allies with their own country’s
            continued welcome. For China, this is a chance to advance a model of foreign
            relations based on coldly weighed security and economic interests, rather
            than on lofty talk of building a better Afghanistan where girls may go
            to school. No bonds of affection or trust bind China and the Taliban.
            Instead, China has pursued a few narrowly defined goals during years of
            intensifying contacts with Taliban delegations. China’s list is headed
            by its desire for a stable Afghanistan, especially near that country’s
            short, mountainous border with China. Above all, China has made clear
            that in return for the international recognition that the Taliban crave,
            and (probably rather limited) investments in roads, mines and other infrastructure,
            they must deny any haven to exiles from China’s north-western region of
            Xinjiang, especially Uyghurs. China’s fear is that Uyghur militants, including
            some with combat experience in Syria or training in Iran, may hope to
            enter Xinjiang through Afghanistan. Though China’s iron-fisted rule in
            Xinjiang—featuring the demolition of mosques and the detention of Muslims
            to “cure” them of excessive piety—offends all that the Taliban purport
            to believe, the group needs China’s backing. Its political leader, Mullah
            Abdul Ghani Baradar, duly told China’s foreign minister on July 28th that
            the Taliban will never allow any force to use Afghan territory “to engage
            in acts detrimental to China”.


            For months China has been calling on the Taliban to join a government
            of national unity and embrace a moderate version of Islam. In briefings
            with foreign diplomats in Beijing, Chinese officials now concede that
            they cannot know whether the Taliban’s promises to shun extremism will
            stick. But those same officials apply a favourite Chinese argument to
            Afghanistan’s rapid regime change: namely, that rulers can earn a mandate
            through material success and shows of broad public support, even if they
            never hold elections that impress snooty Westerners. Afghanistan fell
            without much of a fight, Chinese diplomats say in private. That suggests
            the Taliban enjoy a measure of legitimacy.


            Praising the Taliban to the Chinese public carries risks. For a few hours
            a social media post by the People’s Daily, the party’s flagship newspaper,
            tested the line that the Taliban are former students from refugee camps
            who gained power with the support of the poor. The post went viral, but
            not in a good way, promoting complaints from netizens at warm words for
            a group known for brutalising women and beheading people in public. First
            the post was deleted, then online references to it censored.


            Scolding America is more popular. In a telephone call, the foreign minister,
            Wang Yi, advised the secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, to reflect on
            the lesson of Afghanistan: that a foreign model cannot be “arbitrarily”
            applied to a country with a very different history and culture. Though
            America and China share an interest in Afghan stability, Mr Wang hinted
            that Chinese help might not come free. He grumbled that the Biden administration
            cannot seek to “contain and suppress China” then turn round and “hope
            for China’s co-operation”. The foreign ministry’s spokeswoman was still
            more scornful, calling America a destructive force that leaves “turbulence,
            division, broken families, deaths and other scars” wherever its troops
            tread.


            State media boast that America is exposed as an unreliable ally. Special
            glee is reserved for the panic presumed to grip Taiwan, the democratic
            island that China claims as its own and that mainland leaders are sworn
            to invade, should it declare formal independence. Strikingly, when Taiwan’s
            prime minister, Su Tseng-chang, was asked whether his government, if attacked,
            might collapse like Afghanistan’s, he did not offer bluster about America
            showing up for sure. Instead, Mr Su drew another lesson from Afghanistan:
            that outsiders cannot save a country in internal disarray. Taiwan must
            believe it can defend itself, he told reporters in Taipei.


            China, a reliably self-interested power


            Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Centre for Afghanistan Studies at Lanzhou
            University, calls the blow to America’s global reputation the big upside
            for China. Against that, Mr Zhu concedes that China dislikes uncertainty.
            What is more, some Chinese scholars worry that by leaving Afghanistan,
            America has freed resources to focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Overall,
            he argues against exaggerating his country’s Afghan interests. Afghan
            chaos would be troublesome, but the Chinese border is not hard to lock
            down, and the West is the main target of Islamists, not China, he says.
            Mr Zhu scoffs at talk from Western analysts about Chinese ambitions to
            bind Afghanistan into its Belt and Road Initiative, a globe-spanning infrastructure
            scheme. “The economic gain would be small,” he ventures, noting that the
            BRI currently bypasses Afghanistan.


            Chinese officials used to be defensive about their focus on economic development
            and stability. They asked others to respect China’s version of universal
            values, adapted to the conditions of a large, poor country. Now, they
            challenge the very notion of values-based foreign policies. Those may
            sound benign, it is argued, but are really cover for Westernisation, a
            disastrous folly. China is ready for a post-American age, guided by cold
            realism. That is a polarising moral to draw from Afghanistan’s agonies,
            that many in the West will find hard to welcome. These are polarising
            times.'

        title: In Sierra Leone, a Chinese port-building plan raises ire
        text: 'T ITO GBANDEWA sweeps a hand across a beach in Sierra Leone that many
            call one of the most beautiful in west Africa. The bark of nearby trees
            can cure a child’s cough, locals say. The nectar of its palms comes “from
            God to man”. In the distance, a boy fishes for grouper; children play
            in the surf. If the government has its way, all this will be gone, says
            Mr Gbandewa, who runs a small resort on the beach. In its place will be
            a Chinese-funded fishing harbour covering 100 hectares.

            The project at Black Johnson beach (pictured) is officially described
            as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure scheme.
            Sierra Leone is one of the world’s poorest countries and has long needed
            a harbour for deep-sea fishing boats. China has agreed to give it $55m
            to help build the port. But when details leaked out in May they were not
            well received. Many Sierra Leoneans fret that the project may threaten
            the surrounding rainforest and the country’s fledgling tourism industry.
            Some fear the development will include a fishmeal plant, which could make
            the environmental impact all the worse. The government says this is untrue.


            Even some fisherfolk were alarmed. Around the world, including along the
            west African coast, China is buying fleets and building ports to help
            satisfy its own demand for fish. “They are creating a closed loop for
            their own supply chains,” says Whitley Saumweber of the Centre for Strategic
            and International Studies, an American think-tank. The impact is evident
            in west African waters, which are among the most overfished in the world.
            Chinese boats account for three-quarters of Sierra Leone’s modern fishing
            fleet. Reports abound that they catch more fish than they are legally
            allowed to. Locals who depend on fish for protein cannot compete. A single
            high-tech trawler can catch five times as much in a day as a small village
            fleet can in a year. Controlling ports, or having preferential access
            to them, makes it easier to bypass international restrictions on overfishing.


            Belt and Road projects are often murky. For the one in Black Johnson,
            no environmental assessment has been carried out. Landowners have not
            been consulted. Tourism is crucial to Sierra Leone’s long-term plan for
            achieving middle-income status, known as “the Agenda for Prosperity”.
            But a tourism official says her ministry was not informed of the plan
            either. The fisheries ministry says bidding for the construction contract
            will be open and transparent. Chinese media suggest that two Chinese firms
            have already secured the deal.


            It may smell fishy, but “there is no Chinese conspiracy,” says Jinghan
            Zeng, who follows China-Africa relations at Lancaster University in Britain.
            Chinese investors are still relatively new to Africa, so they make mistakes,
            he suggests. China’s state-owned firms often act like Western companies:
            pursuing profit without much regard for their home country’s diplomatic
            interests. In asking China for the grant to build the port, Sierra Leone
            was not necessarily making itself subservient: the country had previously
            axed plans to build an airport with $318m of Chinese loans.


            Many Sierra Leoneans would disagree. They believe that China is hoovering
            up their country’s rich natural resources (timber, minerals and fish)
            with no regard for locals—and with the complicity of corrupt officials.
            In a survey last year, only 41% of respondents said China’s influence
            on their country was positive. That was down from 55% in 2015, and was
            a lower share than in all but one of the 18 African countries covered
            by the study. The mood in Sierra Leone has also soured since June, when
            a video published on social media showed a Chinese worker attacking a
            Sierra Leonean miner.'

        title: How Chinese factory-workers express their views on life
        text: 'A S TRENDSETTERS GO , Luo Fuxing was an implausible one. A school drop-out,
            Mr Luo spent his days catching fish and herding goats in a village in
            southern Guangdong province. Eating pork was a once-weekly treat. At the
            age of 14, he left home to earn a wage in the province’s sweatshops. He
            hated the tedium of the work. He read that American criminals had tattoos
            of spiders’ webs inked onto their elbows to show time spent behind bars.
            Mr Luo got one too, because “the factory was just a bigger prison.”

            He quit for a job in a hair salon. Inspired by Japanese manga and punk
            fashion, he dyed his hair and styled it into dramatic, gravity-defying
            spikes. Dark lipstick and eyeliner completed the look. He posted selfies
            to QQ , a messaging service—and soon hundreds of thousands of factory-town
            youth were copying his style. Mr Luo called its adopters the shamate,
            from a Chinese rendering of “smart”. It was “a wild-growing art form among
            workers”, he says. The trend, which peaked around a decade ago, helped
            newly arrived migrants from the countryside to bond. They met in parks,
            roller-skating rinks and online groups, where they shared not just sartorial
            cues but gripes about migrant life, from low pay and poor conditions to
            divorcing parents.


            China has developed a distinct working-class culture in recent years,
            of which shamate fashion is only the most garish example. In mainstream
            media assembly-line workers are commonly shown in serried ranks and drab
            uniforms, with no hint as to how they spend their time outside factory
            walls. The stereotype is that workers who migrate to boomtowns and big
            cities—as 300m have done over the past four decades—are there only to
            earn a living. They are still commonly referred to as “migrant workers”,
            on the assumption that they are outsiders who will return to their rural
            hometowns. Many once did. But today’s working-class youth have no interest
            in going back to the land; many have lived in the city from a young age.
            They want to put down roots. Although marginalised in mass culture, workers
            are expressing themselves, in forms as varied as poetry and short videos
            shared online.


            The government tends to portray migrant workers as patriotic and self-sacrificing.
            A museum dedicated to them in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, lauds
            their contribution to China’s economic ascent. Exhibits extol the Communist
            Party’s efforts to improve workers’ livelihoods and applaud their diligence.
            A sign at the entry reads: “Guangdong lets migrant workers create proud
            glories and legends again and again!” The hardship of factory work is
            glossed over, as are common injustices such as withheld wages.


            Elsewhere, workers are often treated as country bumpkins. A “migrant-workers”
            version of the annual Spring Festival Gala, a big television show broadcast
            on the eve of the lunar new year, airs on a channel about agricultural
            news. Workers who began to stage their own unofficial gala some years
            ago were condescendingly described by state news outlets as offering “a
            little song, a little dance and a lot of passion”.


            Small wonder that a coruscating memoir by Fan Yusu, a domestic worker
            living in Beijing, was a national sensation when it was published online
            in 2017. Ms Fan is now the editor-in-chief of New Workers’ Literature,
            an unofficial bimonthly journal of working-class writing, launched in
            2019. One genre winning admiration from the literati is called dagong
            shige or “labour poetry”. Its most famous practitioner was Xu Lizhi, who
            worked on an assembly line for Foxconn, a Taiwanese firm that makes most
            of Apple’s iPhones. Before he committed suicide in 2014, at the age of
            24, he had written almost 200 poems about the drudgery of factory work.
            Among the best known is “I Swallowed An Iron Moon”:


            I swallowed an iron moon


            they called it a screw


            I swallowed industrial wastewater and unemployment forms


            bent over machines, our youth died young


            I swallowed labour, I swallowed poverty


            swallowed pedestrian bridges, swallowed this rusted-out life


            I can’t swallow any more


            everything I’ve swallowed roils up in my throat


            I spread across my country


            a poem of shame


            Many workers’ poems refer to homesickness, alienation, injuries and powerlessness.
            A few deliberately evoke beauty, in jarring contrast to their bleak surroundings.
            In “Sundress”, Wu Xia—a rare female worker-poet, hired by a textile factory
            at the age of 14—writes of her love for the “unknown girl” with the means
            to buy the garment she sews. She also thus lays bare the elusive promise
            of social mobility that drives so many to the assembly line: Ms Wu, now
            40 and a published poet, still works at a clothing factory.


            The packing area is flooded with light


            the iron I’m holding


            collects all the warmth of my hands


            I want to press the straps flat


            so they won’t dig into your shoulders when you wear it


            and then press up from the waist


            a lovely waist


            where someone can lay a fine hand


            and on the tree-shaded lane


            caress a quiet kind of love...


            Some literature is defiant, including towards government policies that
            make it extremely hard for factory-workers born in rural areas to make
            use of schools and hospitals in the cities. In “Who Can Forbid My Love”,
            Ms Wu writes of her adoptive city of Shenzhen: “This kind of love seeps
            into the pores, skin, cells, blood, bone / Even though there’s no residence
            permit with my name on it.” Chen Nianxi, a worker in a private mine, speaks
            of fellow miners who, employed by state-run firms, toil less yet earn
            more while he must blast “the rocks layer by layer / to put my life back
            together”. (English translations of these and other poems were published
            in 2016 in “Iron Moon”, an anthology of labour poetry.)


            Such writing is tolerated by the government partly because journals like
            New Workers’ Literature are written for limited circulation and may not
            be sold in bookshops. Many poets publish online where, to avoid censorship,
            they steer clear of “unfiltered representations of the horrors” inside
            unregistered workshops known as “black factories”, notes Maghiel van Crevel
            of Leiden University. Some poems are proud or patriotic; many of those
            who write are motivated by a desire to earn respect. In the visitors’
            book at the museum in Guangzhou, a visiting labourer has written: “Migrant
            workers, working souls, we’re the finest of them all.”


            Yet workers’ writing is not fundamentally about political resistance,
            says Mr van Crevel, who studies labour poetry. Few blue-collar youths
            today feel they belong to a cohesive working class. That is partly because
            officials and state media avoid using the word “class”, or jieji, owing
            to its antagonistic overtones. (“Social stratum”, or jieceng, is preferred.)
            Many young workers call themselves dagong ren, a word for labourer that
            connotes temporary and low-status work. Its most extreme display is a
            subculture in Shenzhen whose members style themselves “Sanhe gods”. These
            young migrant workers hang around the city’s Sanhe job market to find
            day work, often as builders or delivery drivers. They reject the grind
            of the factory; their slogan is: “Work for a day, party for three.” Some
            even sell their national-identity cards.


            Becoming a shamate was also a form of rebellion against the monotony of
            factory life. In a Chinese documentary released in 2019, “We Were Smart”,
            70 former and current shamate shared their views on what it meant to be
            one. Their exuberant hairstyles turned heads. “People paid attention.
            It wasn’t positive attention. But they saw you. And the point was to be
            seen,” says one interviewee. Many felt they were part of a select group,
            and that cutting their hair would have meant going back to being “just
            another unknown line worker”. For some, the punk identity became more
            important than earning a better wage at a big factory, where they would
            have been forced to cut their hair. For men and women alike, it was a
            way of seeming tougher in a disorienting new city where many were cheated:
            “We felt we weren’t safe out there. That we were too honest, and were
            afraid of being messed with.” The hair, tattoos and clan mentality all
            helped.


            Not much space for self-expression


            As the fashion spread, its adherents began to be ridiculed by prim, middle-class
            netizens. A sustained online attack against shamate around 2010 led thousands
            to lop off their hair and drop out of the group. Police began to round
            up anyone with the telltale style, to check their papers; anyone without
            a temporary residence permit would be detained.


            Shamate fans still congregate in parts of Guangdong. But the fashion has
            lost its edge as factory youth have found a new way to express themselves:
            video-sharing apps. Lorry drivers, construction workers and farmers have
            built followings and sometimes found stardom—not despite being blue-collar
            workers, but because of it. In manufacturing hubs, where phones are often
            banned inside factories, assembly-line workers document their lives outside
            them. Widely used hashtags include #FactoryLife and #LiftTheBucket. The
            last refers, often ironically, to quitting a job in search of a better
            one, with nothing but a bucket of belongings.


            Through the videos, workers cheer each other on. They trade information:
            which factory has higher wages or fairer bosses, say. That is especially
            useful in a “hostile environment where there is no trade union to tell
            them about working benefits”, says Aidan Chau of China Labour Bulletin,
            an NGO in Hong Kong. Some speak of injuries or sexual harassment. Others
            parody the trendy life of urban middle-class youth. “Their aspiration
            to live in a city and become an urban citizen grows, even as they realise
            it is implausible—even impossible,” says Mr Chau.


            Whether expressed in poems or through video-sharing apps, a sense of disillusionment
            seems to be growing. There was once pride in being a worker, says Mr Luo.
            “Now it’s embarrassing to say you’re one.” Young people working in factories
            see short videos as an escape: a way to kill time, but also to be part
            of a wider world beyond their gritty boomtowns. Yet even online, they
            struggle to gain acceptance. Zhang Yurong is among a handful who have
            built a wide following by recording life as a worker at Foxconn. Some
            comments on her videos say factory workers are “people abandoned by society”.
            That angered her, she says, not because it was wrong but because it was
            right.


            A fellow worker-poet and friend of Xu wrote in tribute after his death:
            “Another screw comes loose / Another migrant-worker brother jumps / You
            die in place of me / And I keep writing in place of you.” '

        title: China’s efforts to lift Xinjiang’s economy may smother it
        text: 'C HINESE OFFICIALS used to insist that social harmony in Xinjiang could
            be achieved only by developing the far-western region’s economy. But in
            2014 the government began to argue that for economic development to occur,
            stability was needed first. This small shift in wording heralded the fiercest
            storm.

            Authorities had long been troubled by occasional violence involving Uyghurs,
            a mainly Muslim ethnic group that makes up more than 40% of Xinjiang’s
            population of 26m. Over the past five years China has demolished thousands
            of Xinjiang’s mosques, thrown a million of its people into camps for “re-education”,
            placed the rest under high-tech surveillance and cut their links with
            the outside world. The government has shrugged off international criticism
            and Western economic sanctions against companies and officials deemed
            responsible for these abuses.


            Buildings and roads around Xinjiang are decked today with signs proclaiming
            that the government wants “long-term peace”. It says there have been no
            “terrorist” incidents in Xinjiang since 2017, when it began rounding up
            Uyghurs for even the most trivial displays of religious or ethnic loyalty,
            such as praying in a public place or wearing a beard.


            Now China is turning back to the economy. That does not mean easing repression.
            Highways remain dotted with checkpoints. Cameras rotate to track people
            as they walk past. The detention camps seem to have transferred many inmates
            to regular prisons. But Xinjiang is also launching industrial zones, pouring
            money into infrastructure and building new cities.


            Already, Chinese officials are boasting of success. In July Chinese diplomats
            at the UN organised a video conference in which they insisted that Xinjiang
            was prospering, contrary to the “smears” of Western media. Late last year
            Xi Jinping, China’s president, said Xinjiang had scored “unprecedented
            achievements” in developing its economy and improving people’s lives.
            The reality is much grimmer.


            Xinjiang’s economy can be divided into two halves. Much of its wealth
            and importance for China derives from its abundant supplies of energy.
            Related industries—oil and gas extraction, power generation and chemicals—account
            for more than half the region’s industrial output. As in other resource-rich
            parts of the world, they are relatively disconnected from society. They
            depend more on capital from large state-owned firms than on labour, and
            are concentrated in the sparsely populated north.


            The other half of Xinjiang’s economy is more agrarian and more informal,
            centred in the south, where most Uyghurs live. This is the half the government
            is focusing on. There are three main planks to its efforts: fostering
            industries that create lots of jobs; reconfiguring the area’s economic
            links with other parts of China and the world; and promoting tourism.


            The government has long encouraged labour-intensive industries to set
            up in Xinjiang. Now it is trying much harder. In its latest five-year
            plan for the region, finalised in June, it stressed the importance of
            basic manufacturing. It sees factories as the best source of steady, well-paid
            jobs.


            Human-rights groups sense ulterior motives. Analysis of satellite imagery
            points to factories being built alongside many of the region’s expanding
            prisons. Testimonies from inmates suggest that forced labour is common.
            Many of those released from re-education camps seem to be on indefinite
            probation, compelled to work wherever they are assigned.


            The government denies such allegations. It claims to have created jobs
            last year for about 2.7m “surplus labourers” in Xinjiang, many in textile
            factories. At present, textiles account for only about 2% of Xinjiang’s
            industrial output. That should soon start to rise. From Manas in the north
            to Bachu in the south, the government plans to boost production by building
            seven industrial parks, three industrial zones and a trading hub in Urumqi,
            the region’s capital. Employment in Xinjiang’s textile industry has grown
            from about 400,000 in 2017 to nearly a million today. The industry appeals
            to the government because it can be contained almost entirely within the
            region, from planting cotton (Xinjiang produces 20% of the world’s supply)
            to spinning yarn and making clothes.


            About 25km outside Kashgar, the biggest city in southern Xinjiang, lorries
            unload bales of cotton at the factory gates of Dongchunxing, a state-owned
            fabric-maker that started production just four years ago and now has 5,000
            employees, mostly Uyghurs. At lunchtime the scene looks similar to factories
            elsewhere in China. Workers in loose blue uniforms saunter out, some crowding
            round a snack stall, others zipping off on electric motorbikes.


            A five-minute drive away, though, is a more sinister sight: two police
            checkpoints restrict access to another textile park, managed by the government
            of Akto county in Kizilsu prefecture, which borders Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
            Nearby is a cluster of dormitory-like buildings behind the high walls
            of what an Australian think-tank has identified as a re-education facility.
            At one checkpoint, a Uyghur security guard sits at a table with two books
            on it: a short history of the Chinese Communist Party and a selection
            of Mao Zedong’s quotations. It is the kind of material that China believes
            will help cure wayward Muslims of extremist tendencies.


            One difficulty with China’s industrial plans in Xinjiang is that many
            in the West want nothing to do with them. In July America’s Senate passed
            a bill that bars all goods from Xinjiang, unless importers can prove they
            were not made with forced labour—a virtually impossible standard.


            The second part of China’s strategy could help overcome this hurdle. It
            involves making it easier for goods and labour to move around and out
            of Xinjiang. Over the past five years, the local railway network has expanded
            by 1,530km, or 25%. Over the coming five years the region will build 15
            civilian airports, bringing the total to 37. Links with other countries
            are being strengthened. Of the six trade corridors that form China’s Belt
            and Road Initiative, three pass through Xinjiang (see map). The dry ports
            of Khorgos and Alashan—both on the border with Kazakhstan—have become
            busy. Exports from the Kashgar area, which plunged by nearly 50% in 2018
            at the height of the re-education detentions, have stabilised over the
            past year. A manager outside the Akto textile park brushes aside a question
            about American sanctions. “Our products aren’t for the West anyway. We
            sell to Pakistan and Kazakhstan,” he says.


            The third element, promoting tourism, could reap considerable benefits.
            Revenues from tourism already amounted to a quarter of Xinjiang’s GDP
            before the pandemic. It also helps advertise China’s success in imposing
            stability. This year about 200m tourists are expected. By 2025 the government
            wants to double that number to 400m, almost all from China.


            From Silk Road to theme park


            The message that Xinjiang is stable may also encourage more people from
            China’s ethnic majority, the Han, to settle in the south, diluting its
            Uyghur culture. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a Han-dominated
            state-owned conglomerate that functions like a state within a state, says
            it wants to encourage “southward development”. The bingtuan, as it is
            known, offers subsidies to migrants from outside Xinjiang. In Caohu, a
            village run by the bingtuan south of Kashgar, a Han construction worker
            from Shaanxi province says he was given a house when he agreed to settle
            there permanently.


            Two years ago armoured vehicles and paramilitary police were ubiquitous
            in Kashgar. Today the city looks less intimidating, but retains few reminders
            of Uyghur identity. Streets that once echoed with calls to prayer are
            lined with trinket stalls. In one mosque near the centre, the room where
            worshippers used to wash themselves has been turned into a tourist toilet.


            On heavily stage-managed trips, China has started bringing foreign diplomats
            to Xinjiang. When consuls-general based in Shanghai from countries including
            Belarus, Cuba and Serbia visited in June, Kashgar looked more like a theme
            park than an ancient Silk Road city, with Uyghurs in bright clothes singing
            and dancing to welcome the visitors. “We have seen the great effort by
            the government to improve the lives of local people,” gushed the consul-general
            of Singapore, according to Xinjiang Daily, a state-run newspaper.


            Yet even in economic terms, the government’s story is unconvincing. Cash
            is flooding into the region: investment in factories, roads and other
            fixed assets rose by 16% in 2020, more than five times faster than the
            national average. But Xinjiang’s economy grew by only 3%—a weak outcome,
            given such spending.


            Officials may hope that Xinjiang will follow the model of coastal provinces
            such as Guangdong and Zhejiang, where the path to prosperity began with
            factories that made cheap clothes and shoes. Yet the coast’s take-off
            was led by private entrepreneurs and made possible by a relatively free
            labour market. Uyghur workers, even if they are not in labour camps, cannot
            easily change jobs, let alone move around China without being hounded
            by police.


            Many of the biggest investors in Xinjiang are state-owned firms, driven
            not by profit but by political duty. In the past Xinjiang had its own
            business leaders who were Uyghurs. But officials saw them as a threat.
            Many have disappeared into prisons and re-education camps. Far from laying
            a foundation for growth, the pursuit of such stability is more likely
            to end in stagnation. '

        title: China is rapidly building new nuclear-missile silos
        text: 'O N A HOT and sticky day in the northern city of Tianjin, America and
            China held their highest-level meeting on Chinese soil since Joe Biden
            was sworn in as America’s president in January. But the encounter on July
            26th between Wendy Sherman, America’s deputy secretary of state, and counterparts
            from China’s foreign ministry failed to clear the air. Instead, it merely
            deepened the gloom that hangs over the world’s most critical great-power
            relationship.

            According to an American spokesman, Ms Sherman promised “stiff competition”
            with China and raised its “ongoing genocide” in the far-western region
            of Xinjiang, among other sore issues. She suggested co-operation on tackling
            problems such as climate change, narcotics and Afghanistan. But that olive
            branch was snapped by Xie Feng, a deputy foreign minister, who said relations
            were at a “stalemate” and thundered that America’s aim was to “bring China
            down”. His boss, Wang Yi, told America to choose between improving ties
            or “clashes and confrontation”.


            Mercifully, the two nuclear-armed countries do not appear as close to
            military conflict as the Soviet Union and America sometimes did during
            the cold war. But as the diplomats were sparring in Tianjin, the Federation
            of American Scientists ( FAS ), a research group, said it had spotted
            China building as many as 110 silos for intercontinental ballistic missiles
            ( ICBM s) near the city of Hami, in eastern Xinjiang (see picture). A
            month earlier, the James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, an
            NGO in California, had identified 120 silos being built in Yumen, in the
            desert of Gansu, a neighbouring province. Both outfits found the sites
            by poring over satellite imagery from Planet, an American firm.


            Nuclear wonks were shocked. For decades, China has hewed to a policy of
            “minimum deterrence”, involving the maintenance of a relatively small
            arsenal that would allow it to hit back at aggressors but not wage an
            elaborate nuclear war. The Pentagon reckons the country has 200 or so
            operational warheads—about the same number as Britain or France—and only
            100 or so ICBM s. (America and Russia have nearly 12,000 warheads between
            them.)


            The FAS says the satellite pictures suggest the “most extensive” building
            of silos since the construction of them by America and the Soviet Union
            during the cold war. On July 27th America’s Strategic Command, which is
            in charge of nuclear weapons, reacted with a tweet: “This is the second
            time in two months the public has discovered what we have been saying
            all along about the growing threat the world faces and the veil of secrecy
            that surrounds it.” America’s State Department said the discoveries were
            “deeply concerning” and demonstrated that China was “deviating” from its
            long-established nuclear strategy.


            Experts believe the silos are designed for China’s newest ICBM , the DF
            -41, which can reach most of America’s mainland (see map). The question
            is why so many are needed. One theory is that they allow China to play
            a “shell game” with its missiles—an old conjuring trick in which a ball
            is placed under one of three cups that are shuffled to conceal where it
            is.


            China would have good reason to bamboozle others about the precise whereabouts
            of its missiles. It has long feared that, in a crisis, America could use
            its large arsenal—or even a new generation of highly accurate conventional
            missiles—to wipe out China’s meagre forces on the ground. If some Chinese
            missiles were able to survive such an onslaught, they could be disabled
            in flight by America’s burgeoning missile defences, including interceptors
            in Alaska and California. In other words, China’s nuclear arsenal could
            be rendered useless. America stresses that its missile-defence systems
            are not directed at Russia, but makes no such commitment about their use
            against China. If, however, missiles could be moved underground between
            silos, America would have no way of knowing which ones to strike. America’s
            “ MX ” programme, launched in the 1970s, could have inspired China to
            use such trickery. The idea was to shuffle 200 missiles among almost 5,000
            bunkers in Utah and Nevada. The plan was shelved in 1981 by America’s
            then president, Ronald Reagan. He mocked it as a needlessly complex “Rube
            Goldberg scheme”—a reference to that American cartoonist’s drawings of
            fanciful contraptions for accomplishing simple tasks. The layout of the
            Chinese silos may suggest a similar aim, says James Acton of the Carnegie
            Endowment, an American think-tank. He points out that China’s older silos,
            in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, are tens of kilometres apart,
            whereas the ones in Gansu are only about 3km from each other. Mr Acton
            also argues that because most DF -41s would probably have more than one
            warhead, China would not have enough fissile material to fill all the
            new silos with them, not least because of competing demand for its use
            in other nuclear weapons. The country is thought to have stopped producing
            plutonium in the 1980s. There is little evidence that it has resumed,
            although new nuclear-power reactors being built in Fujian, a coastal province,
            could do so in future. Not everyone is convinced that China is merely
            planning a shell game. In theory, and in the long term, 230 new silos
            could support the deployment of 230 new missiles with several hundred
            warheads, since each missile can carry at least two of them and perhaps
            many more. American officials have long been arguing that China is rapidly
            expanding its nuclear forces. In its most recent annual report on China’s
            military power, published last September, the Pentagon said the country’s
            stockpile of warheads was projected to “at least double in size” over
            the next decade. In April the head of Strategic Command, Admiral Charles
            Richard, presumably aware of the silo fields, said that China’s programme
            was advancing so quickly that intelligence was becoming out of date within
            a month.


            The discovery of the silo-building projects raises two broader questions.
            One is whether they will prompt a change in China’s nuclear posture. America
            and Russia keep some weapons on high alert, ready to launch at a moment’s
            notice. China does not. But silo-based ICBM s can be launched more quickly
            than those on mobile launchers, which have to be erected and, in some
            cases, fuelled. American officials argue that with plenty of instantly
            ready missiles to hand, and with the more advanced early-warning radar
            that China is beginning to develop (with Russia’s help), along with an
            early-warning satellite already in polar orbit, the country may adopt
            a policy of “launch on warning”. That means it would be ready to fire
            missiles at the first sign of a nuclear strike.


            The other question is whether this will affect nuclear-arms control. The
            last remaining pact between America and Russia, the New START treaty,
            was renewed in February and will expire in five years. If the White House
            sees the new silos as confirmation of a rapid nuclear expansion, it may
            adopt the former Trump administration’s view that any future arms-control
            measures must involve all three powers.


            For now, the State Department says that the construction of the silos
            “reinforces the importance of pursuing practical measures to reduce nuclear
            risks”. But China is reticent about exposing its arsenal to scrutiny.
            And the fractious meetings in Tianjin suggest there is little likelihood
            of negotiations over such a contentious matter, let alone a productive
            outcome.'

        title: Amid extreme weather, China avoids mention of climate change
        text: 'E VEN A SHORT spell submerged in floodwaters is enough to transform
            a car into an eerie, unfamiliar object. A week after ferocious rains first
            battered the central province of Henan, the hulk of a white Toyota—fronds
            of waterweed wrapped round its buckled frame—lay on a muddy street in
            Mihe, a hard-hit riverside town, like a long-lost shipwreck. Just finding
            the car had taken several days, its owners explained. It had been carried
            two kilometres downstream by the Sishui river, storm-swollen into a murderous
            torrent many times its normal width.

            Scores died in the floods across Henan province, some of them in subway
            trains and road tunnels that remained open long after meteorologists issued
            a red-alert warning of lethal weather. China’s propaganda machine is on
            the defensive. It has cast this terrible human tragedy as a “sudden act
            of nature”: an exceptional event that could not be planned for. State
            media have lined up scientists to describe how air filled with water vapour
            by a summer typhoon was concentrated and forced upwards by two mountain
            ranges. It dumped a year’s worth of rain in four days over flat plains
            crossed by several rivers, at one point dropping over 200mm of rain on
            the city of Zhengzhou in a single hour.


            Alongside technical talk about the storm’s rarity, officials have stressed
            how it fits into China’s long history of summer floods. Nodding to the
            centuries-old tradition that successful flood control is a mark of virtuous
            rule, Communist Party newspapers have praised “important instructions”
            on disaster prevention and relief issued by the supreme leader, President
            Xi Jinping. Television has filled with images of soldiers shoring up dykes,
            people being rescued in small boats, and party members organising patriotic
            volunteers. At least in the main party and government-run news outlets,
            one possible cause of the rains has been hardly discussed at all: climate
            change. All summer, extreme weather has sparked loud public debate from
            Canada to Germany and Japan about whether a climate emergency has begun.
            Not in China.


            Talking to locals in Mihe on a recent weekday, Chaguan met many who called
            the floods a one-off event. The fatalists included the young couple who
            owned that shipwrecked Toyota Corolla, encountered as they fished in its
            waterlogged interior for valuables. There is no reason to think such a
            disaster will strike again, said the young man, examining a weed-covered
            set of keys and a bank card. It was “a once-in-a-1,000-year rainstorm”,
            he declared. That same phrase came up time and again in Mihe, reflecting
            its prominence in approved accounts of the deluge.


            Yet in China, public opinion is seldom quite as constrained by the official
            line as it first appears. Asked whether the weather had changed in their
            lifetimes, several locals said that it had. They described summers that
            have grown hotter, and the vanishing of heavy winter snows. Some linked
            those changes to the storm that had just smashed through their town, reducing
            bridges to jumbled slabs of concrete. Locals said they dared not talk
            to a foreign reporter about how many died in the floods in or around Mihe,
            in case they said something forbidden. But a few volunteered that the
            government needed to do more to tackle climate change. “This weather nowadays,
            nobody can navigate it,” said a man who sells plastic-cloth rain covers
            for cars.


            If opinion in Mihe is not monolithic, it is distinctively Chinese. Those
            calling for climate action often went on to describe large-scale engineering
            works, of the sort dear to party bosses. A shopkeeper drying mud-encrusted
            stock in the sun suggested that the Sishui’s channel needed widening.
            “The river is too narrow, the water could not drain away fast enough,”
            he ventured. Others, when asked about the climate, replied with praise
            for the government for cleaning up air pollution in Mihe, notably by closing
            a dirty local coal mine. “The environment now is much better than in the
            past,” said a young man riding on a forklift-truck with his grandfather,
            a wrecked micro-car balanced on its prongs.


            What could not be heard in Mihe were calls for citizens’ campaigns to
            lobby the government. “This is a one-party state,” explained a local,
            flatly. Asked about young people’s views of the climate, a teenager suggested
            that in China, individuals do not believe that their actions will affect
            the environment at large.


            It is no surprise that official media are not rushing to explore connections
            between extreme weather and climate change, says Li Shuo, a policy expert
            at Greenpeace, a campaign group. The media’s job is to mobilise public
            opinion, and Chinese leaders do not expect the people to drive climate
            policy. Nor do they welcome pressure, including from natural disasters,
            to alter their carefully laid plans. “They don’t have much tolerance of
            any external event setting their agenda,” says Mr Li.


            Change in China must come from within


            Outsiders may be tempted to shrug at China’s relative lack of grassroots
            debate. After all, Mr Xi has promised that China will strive to have carbon
            emissions peak before 2030, then decline to net zero by 2060, and his
            word is final. Top-down policies are already seeing solar panels and wind
            farms installed at a prodigious rate.


            In fact, outsiders should hope for more debate at China’s grassroots.
            The country’s climate plans, though bold on paper, are not urgent enough.
            The world needs Chinese carbon emissions to peak years earlier than 2030
            to avoid catastrophic warming. China cannot safely continue to invest
            in new coal-fired power plants at home or abroad. Alas, growing resentment
            of America and the West means that international pressure has an ever-smaller
            effect. In contrast, when the Chinese public grows really impatient, leaders
            pay heed, as when they cleaned up smog-choked skies over Beijing and other
            big cities. In the face of crushing losses, the resilience and grit of
            Mihe’s residents is something to behold. If allowed a more informed debate
            about why disaster struck, some of that same energy might just help to
            save the world.


            Correction (July 30th 2021): An earlier version of this story said China’s
            president, Xi Jinping, had promised that China’s carbon emissions would
            peak in 2030. In fact he said the country would strive to have them peak
            before 2030.

        title: Female surfers ride the wave to China’s Hainan island
        text: 'B ELLA LIU’S family was aghast when she returned to her home inland
            after a year on Hainan, an island province in the south. She had several
            scars and a deep tan. “My mother thought I had become a drug dealer working
            across the border with Vietnam,” says Ms Liu. In fact, the former dietician
            had taken up full-time surfing. But that was almost as shocking. “I nurtured
            you for 20 years, and you just want to float out to sea?” she recalls
            her mother saying.

            Ms Liu is now a surf instructor in Houhai Bay, on the island’s southern
            coast. Small tattoos, including one of a seashell, adorn her muscular
            arms (body art is another taboo in the eyes of hometown folk). Yet surfing
            has changed her “inside and out”, she says. She is not alone in seeking
            out its benefits. Most of her clients are women, many of whom are prepared
            to go against the tide—by plunging into it.


            Hainan’s palm-lined beaches and balmy winters have long been a draw for
            domestic tourists. But even a decade ago it had few surfing enthusiasts.
            When an American expatriate organised a surfing contest there in 2008,
            just two of the 30-odd participants were Chinese. Today Riyue Bay, north
            of Houhai, is home to the national surfing team’s academy, set up after
            the International Olympic Committee accepted surfing as an Olympic sport
            in 2016. (The team did not qualify for the games in Tokyo, which begin
            on July 23rd and where surfing will make its Olympic debut.) The local
            government is now eager to turn Hainan into a global surf destination.
            Its waves are said to be the most dependable ones in China for good surfing.


            There was a time when cars loaded with boards would be pulled over by
            police, and surfers lectured about the dangers of their pastime. Now official
            approval is prompting more people to try the sport. So is the pandemic.
            It has forced many Chinese who would normally have holidayed overseas
            to stay put. Between January and May, Hainan received 11% more visitors
            than in the same period in 2019. Surfing also gained a lift last year
            when “Summer Surf Shop”, a variety show filmed in Riyue Bay, began airing
            on iQiyi, a Netflix-like site.


            On a recent weekday in Houhai Bay, dozens of bikini-clad novices, their
            faces streaked with colourful sunscreen, wobbled on boards in knee-deep
            water. Many come for just one session, hiring coaches who double as photographers
            for social-media-worthy snaps. But dedicated surfers are swelling in number,
            too. All “love nature and the spirit of freedom,” says Ms Liu, the ex-dietician.
            Darci Liu (no relation), China’s first professional female surfer, runs
            retreats for women who want to enjoy the sport. “Surfing showed me a bigger
            world,” she says, one in which “I don’t need to have pale skin, or kids
            by a certain age.” In March she launched Hainan’s first surfing tournament
            for women. Expect ever more of them to catch the wave. '

        title: Academics in Hong Kong suffer curbs on their freedoms
        text: 'H ONG KONG’S universities are on summer holiday. Among the few students
            who remain on campuses, the mood is gloomy. On July 16th police raided
            the offices of the student union at the University of Hong Kong (see picture).
            The city’s police chief said some of the union’s leaders may have breached
            the national-security law that China imposed on the territory in 2020
            following months of student-led unrest in the previous year. After Britain
            ceded control of Hong Kong nearly a quarter of a century ago, its universities
            remained free-spirited bastions of liberalism. Now they are gripped by
            fear.

            The pretext for the raid was a resolution issued by the union expressing
            gratitude for the “sacrifice” of a man who had stabbed a police officer
            before killing himself. The government said the statement was “no different
            from supporting and encouraging terrorism”. The union apologised and its
            leaders resigned. But the authorities did not let the matter rest: police
            seized files from the union building and banned some of the former leaders
            from leaving the territory.


            Student groups in Hong Kong were at the forefront of the upheaval in 2019.
            They are in the Communist Party’s sights. During the protests, mainland
            officials visited Hong Kong to conduct extensive interviews with academics
            and other residents. They asked questions about how student unions were
            funded, how their leaders were elected and their connections with the
            unrest. The mainland’s state-controlled media accused union officers of
            supporting independence for Hong Kong (a crime that later became punishable
            by life in prison under the security law) and spreading anti-party sentiment.


            To avoid arrest, many students now stay clear of campus politics. During
            the just-completed academic year, most universities in Hong Kong did not
            hold student-union elections because of a dearth of candidates. Campus
            authorities are also treating the unions warily. In February the Chinese
            University of Hong Kong severed ties with its union because of concerns
            that the manifestos of some candidates for posts in the student body may
            have breached the vaguely worded national-security bill.


            Academic freedom had started to suffer well before the law was enacted
            just over a year ago. In 2010 Hong Kong’s universities were rated A, meaning
            they were among the world’s freest, on the Academic Freedom Index, a ranking
            developed by several universities and think-tanks in Europe. By 2018 they
            had fallen to the middle band, C . They are now in the D category, only
            slightly better than mainland China’s, which have the lowest grade, E
            . In the past five years the decline in Hong Kong has been sharper than
            in most other countries.


            One reason for this is self-censorship. Some lecturers now avoid sensitive
            topics, worrying that their colleagues or students will report on what
            is said in the classroom. Scholars who teach and write about subjects
            such as Hong Kong, China, civil disobedience and democracy are particularly
            cautious. “It’s impossible to guess where the red line is anyway, because
            there is no clear one,” says an academic who teaches modern Chinese history.
            She says the security law has created a problem for those who specialise
            in such areas: how to encourage objective study of sensitive issues while
            protecting students and other faculty members from becoming victims of
            the security law.


            University administrators are also responsible for Hong Kong’s plummeting
            ratings. Many reports tell of outspoken academics being denied tenure,
            refused promotion or unable to get their contracts renewed. “They never
            say it is political,” says Ip Iam-Chong, who taught at Lingnan University
            for 18 years before its management rejected his application for tenure
            in 2020, despite support from his department, and refused to renew his
            contract, which expires in August. Mr Ip believes his difficulties are
            related to his forthright political views (he founded a pro-democracy
            news platform, InMediaHK).


            Johannes Chan, a prominent supporter of pro-democracy causes, recently
            ceased full-time work at the University of Hong Kong, where he had served
            as a law professor. A two-year extension of his contract beyond retirement
            age (60) had expired. In the past, a five-year extension would have been
            routine; his application for one was turned down in 2018.


            Many academics were disheartened last year when five university presidents
            signed a letter expressing support for academic freedom but saying they
            could “understand” the need for a national-security law (its draconian
            contents were not yet public). “It is upsetting to be part of an institution
            proactively participating in stifling dissent,” laments one academic,
            referring to the repressive climate at her university. She says she and
            many colleagues are looking for jobs in other countries.


            Some believe that the chill on campuses is a sign that the Communist Party—which
            does not operate openly in Hong Kong—has infiltrated academia. Party members
            have long been secretly gathering information about activities on campuses,
            says John Burns of the University of Hong Kong. Last year the university’s
            governing board sacked Benny Tai, a tenured law lecturer who had encouraged
            student protests in 2014. Mr Tai, who is now in jail, said before his
            imprisonment that the decision was not made by the board, “but by an authority
            beyond the university”.


            There is another threat to academic freedom that is not directly related
            to the security law. Mr Burns says the central government in Beijing,
            as well as the authorities in Hong Kong, have put “huge pressure” on universities
            to open campuses on the mainland. Such ventures often involve compromises:
            the subsidiary campuses must observe China’s political taboos. In recent
            years at least two universities in Hong Kong have opened mainland campuses.
            Another five, including the University of Hong Kong, say they will follow
            suit. The territory’s universities risk becoming increasingly similar
            to their mainland counterparts, where liberal thinkers know they must
            keep their mouths shut. '

        title: China is keeping its borders closed, and turning inward
        text: 'I T IS BECOMING clear that China will not, or perhaps cannot, re-open
            its borders soon. The reasons are many. Chinese leaders have declared
            that zero tolerance of covid-19 is a mark of good government. Officials
            are fired if cases are found on their patch, so they lock down whole cities
            to crush even tiny outbreaks. Ordinary Chinese associate the virus with
            fear and stigma, knowing that a single infected person may force thousands
            of neighbours, colleagues or classmates into quarantine.

            The outside world stands for chaos. Propaganda outlets stress that new
            cases involve arrivals from abroad. State media describe foreigners, notably
            Americans, as too selfish, science-scorning and obsessed with individual
            rights to control the virus. Images of mask-less Westerners on crowded
            beaches or rampaging at anti-lockdown protests are a staple of Chinese
            news coverage. Lots of Chinese are cross about a lack of overseas praise
            for their country’s strict approach. Their resentment is both sincere
            and stoked by propaganda that accuses American leaders of slandering China
            to cover up their cruel incompetence and 600,000 pandemic deaths.


            Finally, though open discussion of this question is taboo, the authorities
            are being oddly secretive about how well Chinese-made vaccines work. Locally
            made jabs have been given to two-fifths of the population, with assurances
            that they are highly effective. But few data have been released about
            how Chinese vaccines cope with variants, or how long they work. This opacity
            is a problem. Many developing countries have relied heavily on Chinese
            shots. Indonesia and Thailand are among those now planning booster jabs
            with Western vaccines, at least for medical workers.


            Chinese officials grumble that America and the European Union have yet
            to approve a vaccine from China. But in May, EU regulators trying to inspect
            a vaccine production site near Beijing were stymied by Chinese officials
            who insisted that those busy scientists would have to spend three weeks
            in quarantine. The government rejected an offer for them to fly in by
            charter plane for a brief inspection visit in protective suits.


            Meanwhile, mainland China has yet to approve any foreign vaccines, including
            the most effective ones that use m RNA gene technology. Perhaps China
            wants to protect domestic drugmakers from competition, suggest foreign
            diplomats. Equally, China may want to buy time for a locally made m RNA
            vaccine that is known to be in development. Given all these factors, it
            is not obvious how China will start to re-open, especially before some
            big events have safely passed. These include the Winter Olympics that
            Beijing will host next February and a Communist Party congress in late
            2022, at which Xi Jinping is set to seek a fresh term as supreme leader.


            For their part, foreigners who live in mainland China appreciate being
            in a country that has the virus under control: in spring 2020 hundreds
            of millions of Chinese spent weeks at home to break the chain of transmission,
            often without pay. But quite a few have also had enough. Surveys by the
            American and European chambers of commerce suggested the number of foreign
            residents in China had fallen by 30% in 18 months. International schools
            are braced for a fresh exodus this summer, it is said, including of teachers
            who have not seen families outside China for more than a year. This spring
            several embassies debated whether China should become a hardship posting
            reserved for diplomats without dependents. Their concerns include rules
            obliging all international arrivals, including children, to quarantine
            in a hotel for three weeks, and to enter an isolation clinic if they test
            positive. (Ambassadors may quarantine at home for 21 days, but only if
            their residence is a detached house and they are driven there with a police
            escort.)


            In June Spain’s consulate-general in Shanghai protested after a newly
            arrived Spanish citizen was made to sign documents that she could not
            read and undergo days of tests and MRI scans in a clinic. The Spaniard
            had apparently tested positive for antibodies, either as a result of having
            been vaccinated or after recovering from a bout of covid-19. Chinese officials
            declined to explain.


            Foreign companies in favoured sectors can secure visas for executives,
            or for engineers who are needed to build advanced manufacturing sites
            that China wants. But even the largest such businesses struggle to obtain
            visas for the families of their expatriate staff. As many as half a million
            foreign students at Chinese institutions are stuck outside the country:
            their visas were cancelled in March 2020. Let them study online, Chinese
            officials tell diplomats who mention their plight. International tourism,
            both inbound and outbound, has ground to a halt.


            China now issues a few visas for temporary business and family visits.
            But any further opening provokes nervousness. The southern province of
            Guangdong, hit by a recent virus outbreak, is building a quarantine clinic
            for international arrivals with 5,000 beds. Those foreign airlines allowed
            to operate limited flights into China are often running at 10% of pre-pandemic
            capacity. Visits by political leaders from abroad have largely ceased.
            Some foreign ministers have been admitted to China to meet their counterpart,
            Wang Yi, but only in provincial cities. Beijing, where top leaders live,
            is off limits. Mr Xi attends overseas summits by video-link.


            China wants foreign know-how and respect, not foreigners


            Chinese history has seen many cycles of opening and turning inward. Anecdote
            by anecdote, evidence is mounting that foreigners, whether suspected of
            bearing dangerous germs or ideas, are becoming less welcome. On a recent
            domestic flight, Chaguan’s neighbour pointedly asked to move seats. It
            is growing more common to face demands from members of the public to agree
            that China is strong and the West failing. Nationalism and impatience
            with foreign criticism were on the rise before covid-19. The pandemic
            has sped up those trends—as it has inspired at times nasty anti-Chinese
            racism abroad. Mutual distrust will be hard to overcome until China re-opens.
            That may take a while.

        title: In China’s publishing business, you have to duck and dive
        text: 'T HE BEIJING International Book Fair, which takes place in August,
            gives the better-known view of China’s publishing industry: state-controlled
            and gargantuan. The organiser, China Publishing Group, owns 40 of the
            580 government-run firms that dominate the country’s $15bn book-publishing
            market—second in size only to America’s. But another book jamboree, held
            one month earlier in the capital, shows a less familiar aspect. The abC
            Art Book Fair, which this year ran for three days from July 9th, is all
            that the other is not: independent, eclectic and lean. Readers piled in
            to buy and browse the works of 140 independent publishers (last year’s
            event is pictured). It reflects a small but lively indie-publishing scene.

            The government tightly controls printed matter. Publication codes, such
            as ISBN s, that must be used by all books and periodicals sold in China
            are allocated only to state-run publishers (half of them based in Beijing).
            Censors pore over works before they go to print. The government gives
            another 200 privately owned publishers special permits to operate.


            There are other small unofficial publishers scattered across China. They
            may be legally registered as businesses, but lack publishing licenses.
            At the latest abC fair, an event dating back to 2015, the majority of
            exhibitors were illustrators, comic-strip authors, photobook makers and
            publishers of what the industry calls zines (small pamphlet-like magazines).
            Some were papermakers, or studios offering high-quality printing by letterpress,
            silk screen or, more affordably, by Risograph.


            For decades until “reform and opening” began in the late 1970s, only one
            retailer was allowed to sell books to the public: Xinhua Bookstore, a
            state-run firm. But under Deng Xiaoping private publishers and bookshops
            were allowed to operate again, under close watch. Some bypass restrictions
            on circulation by designating their magazines as neibu, or for “internal”
            reading. That allows distribution among a limited group: neibu materials
            may not be sold to the public. Non-government producers of periodicals
            have to rent the required codes from state entities that no longer need
            them because the journals using them are defunct. Independent book publishers
            have to buy ISBN s from state counterparts, an arduous procedure. Small
            publishers sometimes purchase them in Hong Kong, where doing so is cheaper
            and far simpler. Such an ISBN does not give automatic access to China’s
            market.


            But independent publishers who keep their content free of anything the
            Communist Party might seriously dislike, and who limit their print-runs
            to just a few hundred, can still manage to thrive. “No one is doing this
            to resist” authority, says a magazine-maker in Shanghai. Another, in the
            southern city of Guangzhou, says she devoted one issue to technology,
            but avoided mention of debate about facial recognition. “I can’t risk
            the magazine for one sentence,” she says. “I want to survive.”


            Some publications are more daring. One is Missionary,a thoughtful magazine
            about gay life in China. (Official tolerance of gay rights is limited.)
            A recent issue was on sale at abC. It included discussion of the stigma
            surrounding pornography. Photography books sometimes push boundaries.
            Buried in the pages of one at the fair were a few scenes from the Cultural
            Revolution, showing people being persecuted by a crowd. The book’s editor
            checked them with a friend at a state-run publisher, who did not think
            they would cause trouble (a few independent publishers scoff at the ability
            of censors to spot subtle censure). Some print in a mixture of Chinese
            and English, in part because they hope this will deflect criticism. State
            publishers have little interest in illustrated books for adults. So in
            2018 Aki Jiang set up AKIPRESS to give herself and fellow artists an outlet.
            “Publishing through formal channels is so hard in China,” says Ms Jiang.
            “I wanted to draw freely.”


            Officials appear fine with that, within limits. State publishers attend
            indie book fairs to scout for talent. One such event, called UNFOLD, which
            was first held in Shanghai in 2018, even receives subsidies from the local
            district-level government. Officials there are eager to jazz up the derelict
            industrial zone where the fair takes place. Such co-operation involves
            added scrutiny by censors. Missionary does not participate in UNFOLD.


            Most authors and illustrators feel that Shanghai offers a more relaxed
            environment than the strait-laced capital. Indie publishers there, lacking
            the requisite codes for selling their work in conventional bookstores,
            instead put them in the city’s cafés and boutiques. Officials overlook
            this transgression.


            Independent book fairs have also sprung up in bigger inland cities where
            demand is growing among young, well-educated inhabitants. Bookshops are
            booming: 4,000 opened in China last year, despite the pandemic. Sisyphe,
            a big private chain, has spread to hundreds of malls. Chengdu in the south-west,
            home to more bookshops and libraries than any other Chinese city, subsidises
            new bookshops.


            But the public can be a problem. Some readers use city-government hotlines
            to report on books they deem unsuitable for circulation. One customer
            at Bananafish, a bookshop in Shanghai, complained that it was selling
            a magazine from Taiwan, the government of which China loathes. In fact,
            the publication had been cleared for sale in China. Another called the
            hotline about an 11-page book, printed locally, called “The Old Man and
            the Pigeon”. It is unclear how the work had offended. Perhaps the reader
            had seen sexual innuendo in an illustration of two birds, above a line
            that read: “mating pigeons”. Local censors visited the shop. But they
            chuckled at the story. They took one copy away with them, and left the
            others. '

            a depressingly familiar event. Late on July 6th, those who tried to browse
            accounts run by LGBT societies at several universities in China were greeted
            with messages saying the forums, which had been used to publicise events
            such as webinars and film nights, had been closed for violating unspecified
            rules. The accounts had probably offended the government, which has little
            regard for the rights of sexual minorities and even less for freedom of
            speech.

            In the past, such clampdowns have met resistance. In 2018 Weibo, a Twitter-like
            service, announced a three-month campaign to eradicate pornographic, gay
            and violent content from its services. In 2019 the platform shut down
            a discussion group called Les, aimed at homosexual women. It had 140,000
            members. In both cases, online anger prompted Weibo to rethink. The service
            conducted the clean-up, but decided not to suppress content simply for
            being gay-themed. It allowed the lesbian group to reopen.


            This time the online reaction has been more mixed. Many social-media users
            hailed the closure of the LGBT accounts as a victory for patriots. “External
            forces are trying to weaken China’s competitiveness by spreading propaganda
            about LGBT to reduce China’s fertility rate,” wrote one blogger, gathering
            more than 66,000 views. Some accused LGBT groups of trying to promote
            a “colour revolution” in China, a reference to uprisings against other
            autocratic regimes. Hongwei Bao of Nottingham University says popular
            nationalism in China sometimes adopts the language of the far right in
            the West. That includes anti-Semitic drivel: one Weibo user with nearly
            150,000 followers described LGBT activism as “a culture war initiated
            by the Jewish elite and the white left”. The term “white left” was coined
            in China a few years ago to describe Western liberals obsessed with identity
            politics. Now it is also used to insult Chinese who are deemed to sound
            like woke Westerners.


            Homosexuality has long been vilified as foreign in China. But in the 2000s,
            as China grappled with rising rates of HIV / AIDS , the government dialled
            back the bigotry. In 2001 it removed homosexuality from an official list
            of mental disorders. Since then, at the UN and other international forums,
            it has gone further by endorsing the rights of LGBT people. At least in
            big cities, gay people have reported growing acceptance of their sexuality
            among fellow citizens. “The government doesn’t really care,” says Eric
            Wang (not his real name), who works for an LGBT -rights organisation in
            mainland China. “They’ve got more important things to do than oppress
            us.”


            But rising anti-Western sentiment is hampering this progress. Nationalists,
            egged on by the Communist Party, have become even more vocal during the
            covid-19 pandemic. They have trumpeted China’s success in controlling
            the virus while heaping scorn on the West’s fumbling response. Mr Wang
            says a growing number of Chinese, even those who know gay and transgender
            people, have started “believing in conspiracy theories”. One is that all
            LGBT groups are funded by Westerners.


            Seker Ma, a graphic designer in the eastern city of Suzhou who was involved
            with LGBT groups during his recent time at university, says the atmosphere
            for gay people in China has worsened in the past few months. “A lot of
            the current wave of patriotism takes this view: ‘Whatever the West supports,
            we must oppose,’” says Mr Ma.'

            and trees heavy with ripe mangoes do not evoke digital wizardry. Yet until
            recently, there were buildings here with rack upon rack of specialised
            computers. They were often near hydropower plants that supplied them with
            electricity from dams. They needed lots of power. Their machines were
            used for “mining”, a process that involves validating transactions conducted
            in bitcoin and other digital currencies by solving cryptographic puzzles.
            In return, they received newly minted coins. The buildings were recognisable
            by their huge cooling systems: usually a wall on one side covered in giant
            fans to draw in air.

            But across Sichuan, the fans have stopped whirring. In May, a government
            committee tasked with promoting financial stability vowed to put a stop
            to bitcoin mining. Within weeks the authorities in four main mining regions—Inner
            Mongolia, Sichuan, Xinjiang and Yunnan—ordered the closure of local projects.
            Residents of Inner Mongolia were urged to call a hotline to report anyone
            flouting the ban. In parts of Sichuan, miners were ordered to clear out
            computers and demolish buildings housing them overnight. Power suppliers
            pulled the plug on most of them.


            The clampdown has had a global impact. Bitcoin’s “hash rate”, a measure
            of the computational power being used by the world’s mining machines,
            has fallen by half in recent weeks. Its “difficulty rate”, which rises
            and falls as computers join or leave the mining effort, last week fell
            to an all-time low. China had accounted for about 65% of bitcoins earned
            through mining, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption
            Index. But analysts think about 90% of its mining has now ceased. Chinese
            miners are selling their computers at half their value.


            China’s mining boom began in 2017, after a surge in the price of bitcoin
            caught the attention of local entrepreneurs. The country was already making
            most of the machines that mine bitcoin globally, as well as the tailor-made
            chips on which they run. It also had the capacity to produce more power
            than it needed. In 2018 this excess amounted to 70 terawatt-hours ( TW
            h), equivalent to Switzerland’s total energy production. Rather than let
            the surplus go to waste, plants sold it to mining farms. The seasons would
            determine where those farms operated. After the end of Sichuan’s drenching
            summer rains, when prices there would rise, miners would drive their machines
            to somewhere near a cheaper source, usually coal-fired power plants thousands
            of kilometres away in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. (Energy from solar
            and wind power is not reliable enough to power non-stop mining.)


            In 2017 China, fearing a loss of financial control, banned cryptocurrency
            trading. But local governments still welcomed the miners: they were a
            source of taxes and other levies. In June a state-run zone in Ya’an, a
            city in Sichuan, had been set to open in time for the start of the rainy
            season. It was offering cheap power for mining and other digital activities.
            “It was a win-win,” says Kirk Su, a miner who had been planning to put
            some of his machines in the zone. “China was leading in mining in all
            respects: cheap power, cheap labour, fast and easy access to kit,” he
            says.


            Then came the clampdown. It was targeted in part at the cryptocurrency
            traders. The mining industry itself has little to do with the volatile
            business of trading. But miners could not function without converting
            their new bitcoins into yuan. For this they used exchanges that had moved
            offshore after the trading ban, but still targeted Chinese users. The
            government may have decided that to rid China of crypto transactions,
            “mining had to go”, says Bobby Lee, who co-founded China’s first cryptocurrency
            exchange (it was forced to shut in 2017). He now runs Ballet, an app that
            lets users manage their digital currency.


            Another aim may have been to reduce emissions. The Cambridge numbers suggest
            that Chinese miners used around 83 TW h of electricity a year, similar
            to Belgium’s total power consumption. (Still, China could have chosen
            to ban mining only in its coal-belching north, says Mr Lee.) Officials
            may also have worried about collusion between local governments and mining
            operations, some of which had been getting subsidies earmarked for innovative
            big-data firms.


            The central government said it wanted to “resolutely prevent the transmission
            of individual-level risks to broader society”. That may, in part, have
            been a reference to the activities of some mines that had been setting
            up Ponzi-like schemes, promising big returns to investors. Other scammers
            have been masquerading as cryptocurrency traders. Last year over 100 people
            were arrested for running two such operations, PlusToken and WoToken.


            To evade the clampdown, big miners have sent their machines overseas.
            Mr Su, who also runs a logistics business that transports mining machines,
            has been chartering Boeing 747s to get used ones out swiftly. Most are
            going to Russia and Kazakhstan, which together account for about 13% of
            the world’s bitcoin mining. But there are few data centres abroad with
            space for lots of new machines, including in America, the second-biggest
            miner. Building a farm there costs between five and ten times what it
            does in China, says Mr Su. That is too much for most Chinese miners. More
            than half of their computers will stay put for now, he says.


            Some smaller miners are still finding ways to operate. One says he is
            lucky to have teamed up with a privately owned hydropower station that
            is loth to forgo the extra revenue (it risks being fined by the grid or
            booted off it). While meeting your correspondent, he struck a deal to
            buy a farm from a fellow miner for 5m yuan ($770,000), powered by a plant
            that is off the grid. If his machines can function there for 15 days,
            he will have earned his investment back in bitcoin.


            In an abandoned school in southern Sichuan, Mr Su has stored 10,000 machines
            from some of his shuttered farms. For every day they spend there, unplugged
            and stacked to the ceiling, he says that 1m yuan in potential profit is
            lost. '

        title: A Chinese film removes scenes featuring a young Mao Zedong
        text: 'P ROPAGANDISTS HAD teed it up as one of this year’s blockbusters. The
            film “1921”, named after the year China’s Communist Party was born, was
            intended to grip the imaginations of young people with the story of the
            party’s founding 100 years ago this month. Mao Zedong would be played
            by different actors depending on his age in the scene depicted. One of
            them would be Yan Xujia, a 19-year-old pop star who frequently appears
            on reality television. In mid-May the heartthrob’s profile appeared on
            promotional posters against an orange-yellow background, suggesting the
            dawn of Chinese communism (see picture).

            Yan Xujia, briefly the party’s poster boy But a few months before the
            film’s release on July 1st, reports appeared on entertainment news sites
            that Mr Yan had cheated on a girlfriend. He denied this, but disbelieving
            internet users said he was unfit to play a character as important and
            upstanding as Mao. Some directed their ire at the main producer of “1921”:
            Tencent Pictures, a production house owned by a privately run social-media
            and gaming giant. They accused it of involvement in a capitalist conspiracy
            to smear the party’s most revered founder. “Mao must be portrayed as great
            and glorious. He must not be besmirched,” read one popular comment.


            These posts must have stung officials at the party’s Publicity Department,
            which was closely involved in making the film (with the help of one of
            the country’s most famous directors, Huang Jianxin). Earlier this year
            the law had been amended to make insulting, slandering or infringing on
            the memory of national heroes punishable by up to three years in jail.
            Never mind that Mao was a zealous philanderer while he was married. (Mao’s
            private physician, Li Zhisui, provided lurid details of this in his book
            “The Private Life of Chairman Mao”, which was published in 1994 shortly
            before Mr Li’s death.) No mention is allowed in China of such matters.


            The film has not been a sensation. In its first five days it grossed 300m
            yuan ($46.3m), one third of the amount earned in a comparable period by
            “Fast and Furious 9” (or “F9: The Fast Saga” as it is known in America)
            after the Hollywood action movie was released in China in May. And audiences
            noticed that Mr Yan was missing. In one telling scene, Mao is chased through
            a forest by his parents, but does not appear himself. Online articles
            about Mr Yan being cut were deleted by censors.


            As the party increasingly turns to celebrities for help with spreading
            its message, their private lives are likely to be subjected to ever greater
            scrutiny. Yet the stars know they have little choice but to play along
            with the cultural commissars. At midnight on July 1st, a message posted
            on Weibo, China’s answer to Twitter, by state television said “We will
            forever walk with the party! Best wishes to our great party!” Hundreds
            of popular actors, singers and other celebrities quickly shared the post.
            Their fans followed suit. Within 12 hours, the message had been forwarded
            15m times.


            Without celebrities’ support, state media would struggle to strike such
            a chord. The Weibo account of People’s Daily, the party’s main mouthpiece,
            has about 130m followers. That is about the same as the number who follow
            Xie Na, an actress and television host. Celebrities’ accounts on Weibo
            have more than 21bn followers, almost twice as many as in 2017, the platform
            says. The majority of these fans are 26 or younger. And they are widely
            scattered: almost 90% do not live in the biggest cities.


            But the party’s attempts to boost its ratings among the celebrities’ armies
            of admirers are fraught with difficulty. Officials might give the limelight
            to one heart-throb, such as Mr Yan, only to find that jealous fans of
            another idol take umbrage and try to undermine the reputation of the party’s
            chosen one. Mr Yan may have been the victim of such an onslaught. “The
            filmmakers succumbed to pressure from fans of other actors who went crazy
            reporting and exaggerating Yan’s immorality,” says one Chinese film critic.
            Mao once said that Marxists should not be afraid of criticism from any
            quarter. That is poor advice for China’s entertainment stars. '

        title: In China, patriotic nostalgia is big business
        text: 'F IVE OR SIX years ago, when many Chinese still associated American
            culture with novelty and fun, Halloween was big business in Caoxian. This
            rural county claims to be China’s largest source of cheap costumes for
            children’s parties and school concerts as well as for dramatic galas that
            are sometimes staged in Chinese workplaces, from small factories to government
            ministries. Not long ago, Caoxian’s entrepreneurs could live for a year
            on one month’s sales of pumpkin costumes, witches’ robes and other Halloween
            paraphernalia, says Ren Yafeng, a local costume merchant, perhaps exaggerating
            just a little.

            In the past three years, however, America’s image has darkened and consumers
            have become more nationalistic, nudged by Communist Party propaganda and
            four years of Trumpian bluster. The market signals were swiftly received
            in Caoxian, for this light manufacturing hub in the eastern province of
            Shandong is linked to customers by e-commerce. Officials in Mr Ren’s home
            village, Sunzhuang, report that almost three-quarters of households sell
            goods on such online platforms as Taobao, 1688 and Pinduoduo.


            This month marks the 100th anniversary of the party’s founding. All year,
            orders have poured in to Caoxian for replicas of the Red Army uniforms
            that were worn by Communist guerrillas. Schools have been buying child-sized
            ones for more than a decade, for use in performances. But it is not only
            children who don them. Such costumes are now all-but-required wearing
            for groups visiting party-approved “red tourism” sites, such as bases
            used during the Long March and battlefields where the Communists suffered
            ghastly but inspiring losses. Since January Mr Ren has shipped 100,000
            Red Army uniforms from his warehouse, located at a crossroads between
            cornfields and a duck pond. He hopes to sell the same number again before
            the year is out.


            The sight of grown men and women dressed as soldiers from the 1930s, in
            powder-blue or grey tunics, trousers and octagonal caps bearing a red
            star on the peak, is one of the spectacles of modern China. They can be
            seen panting up Red Army supply trails in Jinggangshan, a mountain in
            southern China called the cradle of the revolution. They can be heard
            reciting Mao’s poems in Yan’an, an old party headquarters, and singing
            red hymns around vats of thin soup that troops might have eaten long ago.
            These are pilgrims, for the party, though atheist, unabashedly talks about
            “sacred” sites, “martyrs” and filling hearts with revolutionary fire.
            The costumes are an aid to faith. Official documents talk of tourists
            being inspired by “wearing Red Army clothes, eating Red Army meals and
            walking Red Army paths”. Some visitors are bureaucrats on government-paid
            study tours, or workers from private firms eager to show loyalty to the
            party. Commercial guides also rent out or sell uniforms to individual
            tourists. Devotion to authenticity varies, with some visitors pairing
            uniforms with trainers and plastic bags full of modern-day snacks. Those
            attentive to detail sport old-fashioned cloth slippers, canvas satchels
            and toy guns.


            Children’s costumes still make up most of Mr Ren’s sales, but adult orders
            are booming. The cheapest Red Army suits sell for 25 yuan ($3.90) while
            more durable uniforms can go for 100 yuan, including a belt and cap. He
            reports seeing a first surge in 2015, the 70th anniversary of victory
            over Japan, and ever-growing orders from revolutionary bases in the past
            two or three years.


            Especially last year, when covid-19 lockdowns forced the cancellation
            of performances, lots of Caoxian’s costume-makers diversified into another
            patriotic fashion, selling the supposedly ancient robes known as Hanfu
            to individual buyers. These floaty gowns and tunics are largely invented,
            based on a mishmash of historical styles. Still, they are embraced by
            many Han Chinese, who make up over 90% of the population. They had lacked
            an ethnic costume they could call their own, unlike Tibetans or other
            minorities. Even children’s costumes are becoming more patriotic. Those
            based on “Journey to the West”, a famous folk saga, are brisk sellers,
            as are some based on a cartoon series from the 1980s about seven brothers
            born from magic gourds. In Sunzhuang locals call national pride a sign
            of progress, suggesting that as the Chinese grow richer and no longer
            worry about their next meal, their minds are turning to “higher things”,
            such as their own history. The village party secretary, Sun Xueping, used
            to encourage locals to seek jobs as migrant workers. Now he urges them
            to stay and make more money selling goods online. If those products reflect
            love of the country and party, “that’s a win-win”, he beams.


            Red tourism, golden opportunities


            Down the lane from Mr Ren’s warehouse, a line of beige uniform trousers
            drying next to a stack of corn cobs reveals a still more specialised business.
            Through a farmhouse gate lies a backyard workshop employing a dozen people
            to make costumes worn by enemy troops decades ago. Inside, workbenches
            are heaped with caps bearing the blue-and-white insignia of the Nationalist
            regime, which the Red Army overthrew in 1949. Boxes hold the black-and-white
            uniforms of Nationalist police, who hunted down underground Communists
            in Shanghai and other cities. These are used by extras in videos or stage
            shows, guesses the workshop’s owner, Ren Gen. He only receives orders
            for adult sizes, perhaps because parents do not want children playing
            villains.


            It is revealing that blue or grey uniforms from the party’s earliest decades
            dominate the replica trade. There is less demand for the green uniforms
            worn in Mao’s later years, including by Red Guards during the Cultural
            Revolution in 1966-76. In Caoxian, as elsewhere, that dark period saw
            temples smashed and people with the wrong class background, or even a
            slender connection to the outside world, tortured by mobs. “People don’t
            really want to mention such things,” says an older local who remembers
            those horrors. Nostalgia is both party-approved and profitable in today’s
            China. It is also selective.'

        url: https://www.economist.com/china/2021/07/04/a-silo-building-spree-raises-questions-about-chinas-nukes
        title: A silo-building spree raises questions about China’s nukes
        text: 'CHINA’S NUCLEAR arsenal is piddling by American or Russian standards.
            The country has scarcely 200 warheads, reckons America’s Department of
            Defence, and perhaps 100 or so inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).
            Until last week it had only 16 known silos for latest-generation ICBMs.
            So eyebrows were raised when satellite imagery revealed 120 new ones being
            built in the desert of Gansu province, in western China.


            The silos, near the city of Yumen, were identified by researchers from
            the James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, an American think-tank,
            whose findings were published on June 30th in the Washington Post. These
            and other experts reckon that the structures are designed to house China’s
            newest ICBM, the DF-41, which can reach almost all of America’s mainland.
            The question is why so many are needed.


            One theory is that they could allow China to play a “shell game”—an old
            conjuring trick in which a ball is placed under one of three cups, which
            are then shuffled. China fears that, in a crisis, America’s large and
            precise arsenal could wipe out China’s meagre nuclear forces. Any Chinese
            missiles that are still able to be launched after such an onslaught could
            be destroyed by American missile defences. But if China’s missiles could
            be moved underground between silos, America may not know which ones to
            strike.


            America’s abandoned “MX” programme of the 1970s and 1980s could have inspired
            such a scheme. The idea of this was to shuffle 200 missiles among almost
            5,000 bunkers in Utah and Nevada. The layout of the Chinese shelters may
            suggest a similar aim, says James Acton of the Carnegie Endowment, a think-tank
            in Washington. He points out that whereas China’s older silos, in Jilantai
            in the neighbouring province of Inner Mongolia, are tens of kilometres
            apart, the ones in Gansu are just 3km apart. Yet not everyone is convinced
            that China is merely planning a shell game. The problem is that 120 new
            silos could also support the deployment of 120 new missiles—and, in theory,
            several hundred new warheads, since each missile can carry more than one.


            American military officials have been arguing for some time that China
            is dramatically expanding its nuclear forces. In its most recent annual
            report on Chinese military power, the Pentagon said that China’s warhead
            stockpile was “projected to at least double in size” over the next decade.
            America’s State Department says that the silo discovery is “concerning”
            and “raises questions” about China’s intent. “I’m afraid the shell-game
            theory is based on a strong hope that China is keeping a minimum deterrent,”
            says Rebeccah Heinrichs of the Hudson Institute, another think-tank. “I
            don’t share that hope and think it’s actually pretty dangerous to hold
            on to it.”


            The discovery of the silos raises two broader questions. One is whether
            they would enable China to respond more quickly to a suspected nuclear
            attack. Silo-based ICBMs can be launched more rapidly than ones carried
            on mobile launchers, which first have to be erected and, in some cases,
            fuelled. Some American officials argue that with plenty of instantly ready
            missiles to hand, and with suitable early-warning radar that China is
            beginning to develop, the country may adopt a posture of “launch on warning”,
            meaning it would fire its missiles at the first sign of a nuclear strike.


            The other question is whether this will affect nuclear-arms control. The
            last remaining pact between America and Russia, the New START treaty,
            was renewed in February and will expire in five years. Although both countries
            have several times more warheads than China, the Biden administration
            wants China to open talks about its own arsenal. If the White House sees
            the new silos as confirmation of a rapid nuclear expansion, it may adopt
            the former Trump administration’s view that any future arms-control measures
            must involve all three powers.


            Ironically, the most benign interpretation of the silos—as a shell-game—is
            in one sense the least encouraging one for arms control. America and Russia
            verify New START by peering into one another’s silos. If China’s plan
            is indeed to shuffle missiles between silos, it would become much harder
            for others to be certain of its deployments. “So the best case,” says
            James Cameron of the University of Oslo, “is that China has gone some
            way to confirming how uninterested in arms control it is.”'

        title: China urges its people to struggle. Some say no
        text: 'T WO VEGETARIAN meals each day. A monthly budget of 200 yuan ($30).
            Working just one or two months a year. In April an internet user posted
            this brief description of his simple, stress-free life. He described his
            philosophy as tangping, or “lying flat”. “I can be like Diogenes, who
            slept in his wine cask in the sun,” he wrote. He included a photo of himself
            doing an appropriate job: playing a corpse in a film.

            The post went viral. On social media, people showed their approval of
            tangping by sharing pictures of themselves (and, often, their cats) lying
            in bed. More than 60% of over 240,000 respondents to a poll on Weibo,
            a Twitter-like platform, said tangping was their idea of the good life.
            On the site, messages with the hashtag “illustrations of young people
            lying flat at home” have attracted about 200m views.


            Tangping describes a longing to escape the pressures of modern life in
            China, where young people are expected to work long hours, buy property,
            get married and have children. Many people in their 20s and 30s grumble
            that hard work no longer rewards them with a better quality of life. They
            have adopted an academic term, neijuan or “involution”, to describe how
            extra input no longer yields more output. Unlike their parents, who enjoyed
            a booming economy, they feel that society is stagnating and inequality
            growing.


            Other ways of expressing this mood have also become common. One is sang,
            or “dejected”: many young people now talk of the spread of a “sang culture”
            in China. They refer to “Buddhist youth”, meaning those who are never
            disappointed since they want nothing. Some young Chinese call themselves
            chives, harvested or exploited by the government and firms. As they point
            out online, it is difficult to harvest chives when they are lying flat.


            Such ideas are at odds with the Communist Party’s rhetoric. Its leader,
            Xi Jinping, likes the word “struggle”. In 2019 an official summary of
            a speech he gave to young officials included more than 50 mentions of
            it. Struggle is an art, he told them. “We must be good at struggle.” Tangping,
            therefore, conveys a whiff of dissent. It hints at rejection of a political
            culture that encourages people to throw their all into work, for the good
            of the country. A popular online comment suggested that tangping had come
            to mean opting out, with defiance: “Lying flat is standing up, horizontally.
            Lying flat is having a backbone.”'

        title: Xi warns against Western “bullies”, to argue for one-party rule
        text: 'F OR ALL who believe that people are endowed with inalienable rights
            including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and that just governments
            derive their powers from the consent of the governed, it was alarming
            to hear the loud applause and cheers that greeted Xi Jinping on July 1st,
            the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party. Speaking at Tiananmen Square,
            China’s leader had just pledged that any foreigner who tried to bully
            China would “dash their heads against a Great Wall of steel, forged from
            the flesh and blood of over 1.4bn Chinese people”. The party crushes individual
            liberties with despotic ruthlessness. Yet its leaders are sure that they
            govern with the consent of the vast majority. As a result they claim to
            enjoy as much legitimacy as any democracy.

            It would be dangerous complacency to dismiss the cheering in the square
            as an empty show. True, the crowd was hand-picked and bused in hours ahead
            of Mr Xi’s arrival. Almost all details of the event were kept secret beforehand.
            But as often with Chinese officials’ paranoia, it was probably unnecessary.
            Without prompting, lots of ordinary people express sincere admiration
            for Mr Xi and would cheer him in person if given the chance.


            The party sees lots of promising forces coming together. After 40 years
            of economic, technological and military progress, it is ready to take
            credit for being an indispensable source of wisdom, guiding China’s rise.
            At the same time, a crisis of confidence grips much of the democratic
            world. Officials delight in comparing their autocracy with what they portray
            as Western disarray. They like to point at America, mocking it as a hellhole
            of covid-19 deaths, racist policing, gun violence and partisan paralysis.


            China’s leaders are, in effect, trying to take established definitions
            of representative government and redefine them to suit the party. Where
            America’s Declaration of Independence called for free men to pursue happiness
            as each saw fit, China’s media say the party seeks “happiness for the
            people”—an unabashedly top-down endeavour. Rather than echo Abraham Lincoln’s
            call for government of, by and for the people, party mouthpieces praise
            Mr Xi as a “people’s leader” whose years of selfless service led him to
            “people-centred development thinking” that focuses on “the fundamental
            interests of the overwhelming majority”.


            Western political systems devote much thought to how governments earn
            and keep the consent of the governed, whether through elections or under
            the continuous scrutiny of a free press, opposition parties and an independent
            judiciary. The party argues that it deserves to rule because of the impressive
            things that it does, and that it is held to account by its own self-discipline.


            Chinese claims to performance legitimacy, to use the jargon of political
            scientists, are often strikingly detailed, and not especially ideological.
            All summer, party organs have praised Mr Xi for providing better education,
            more stable and satisfactory incomes, more reliable social-security payments,
            higher-quality medical services, more comfortable housing and a more beautiful
            environment. This focus on real-world problem-solving is called proof
            that “socialist democracy”, meaning rule by unelected technocrats, is
            more “authentic” than Western political systems. As Chinese officials
            tell it, Western politicians only worry about some people’s interests
            every few years at election time.


            Though Mr Xi is an austere authoritarian, sternly demanding hard work,
            discipline, and sacrifice from party members and the masses alike, he
            also has a populist side. He and his advisers are careful to buttress
            dry lists of achievements with emotive stories about heroic party workers,
            including those who died as martyrs in battle or while serving in harsh
            and dangerous places. A centenary gala at the Olympic stadium in Beijing
            featured a series of elaborate mini-dramas, such as one depicting white-coated
            doctors and nurses battling covid-19.


            When Chaguan was first posted to Beijing as a reporter, 23 years ago,
            officials were somewhat defensive about one-party rule. They described
            their political system as a work in progress, befitting a China that was
            still poor. The party could be hard to spot as reformist leaders wooed
            foreign businesspeople. Visiting bigwigs would often meet government ministers,
            city mayors and university presidents, rather than each institution’s
            real boss, its party secretary. Now senior officials openly talk of their
            faith in the party like priests describing a vocation. “East, west, south,
            north and centre; the party leads everything,” says Mr Xi.


            Ahead of the anniversary Mr Xi has toured revolutionary sites and urged
            study of the party’s history. That does not include Mao-era cruelties,
            which have been largely omitted from centenary-year reflections. People
            who insist on remembering the millions of deaths caused by the party’s
            worst mistakes risk being accused of “historical nihilism”, or the crime
            of slandering party heroes.


            When the majority falls silent


            The party is increasingly unwilling to accept any principled criticism
            of its 21st-century autocracy, which it describes as the moral equal of
            any democracy. In truth, that claim is untested. For one thing, censors,
            propagandists and security agencies devote so much effort to hiding errors
            and silencing critics that it is not possible to say public consent is
            fully informed. For another, every political and economic system eventually
            makes mistakes that are too big to conceal, such as a financial crash
            or defeat in war.


            As plenty of Western experts could attest, reputations for competence
            are powerful assets right up until they are not. China has avoided a grave,
            society-shaking crisis since the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. But
            one will come and, at that point, other forms of legitimacy will be needed.
            Even the party’s focus on serving majority interests is a problem. It
            involves trampling on groups that are millions strong, from Muslims in
            Xinjiang to democrats in Hong Kong. At 100 years old, this remains a party
            to which not all are invited. '

            river. It has grown rapidly since it moved there from nearby Shanghai
            in 2009, churning out destroyers, icebreakers and landing craft for the
            Chinese navy. The jewel in its crown is under construction. China is saying
            little about it, but satellite imagery reveals a near-complete flight
            deck in a corner of the yard where, less than 15 years ago, there was
            only farmland.

            For now, the vessel-to-be is blandly known to military analysts as the
            Type 003. It will be China’s second domestically built aircraft-carrier
            and the largest ship that has ever served in the Chinese fleet. Experts
            at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ), a think-tank
            in Washington, have analysed satellite pictures such as the one above,
            which was taken in June by Planet Labs, an American firm. They conclude
            that the ship will be about as long as New York’s Chrysler Building is
            high: about 320 metres. She will mark another leap forward in China’s
            advance as a naval power.


            China got into the carrier game by an unusual route. In 1985 it bought
            a clapped-out Australian carrier for scrap, then spent years studying
            its design and putting its deck ashore for flying practice. Thirteen years
            later Chinese investors purchased a half-built Soviet carrier and towed
            it from Ukraine to China, purportedly to turn it into a floating casino.
            Instead it was refurbished by the navy and commissioned in 2012 as the
            Liaoning. That helped China to build a knock-off, the Shandong, which
            was commissioned in December 2019 and has been undergoing sea trials.


            The Type 003 could be launched this year, state media say. But building
            carriers is not the same as sailing them. Flying planes off wobbly decks
            is hard. In America, thousands of jets and pilots were lost in the formative
            years of naval aviation. It is also difficult to keep a carrier safe from
            missiles and submarines, and to integrate one into a “strike group” of
            warships. “It’s taken us over 100 years to get that right,” noted an American
            admiral in September. China hopes to be quicker.


            There are signs that it is upping the tempo. Last year the navy put both
            of its carriers to sea at the same time. In April the Liaoning sailed
            through the Miyako Strait, south of the Japanese island of Okinawa; exercised
            near Taiwan and in the South China Sea; and returned the same way. Its
            escorts included the Renhai-class destroyer, one of the world’s most capable
            ships of its kind, as well as a Fuyu-class support vessel, which can replenish
            carrier strike-groups far from home.


            Some Western analysts are impressed by China’s progress. “Considering
            what they had to start with, they’ve done a very good job,” says Mark
            Montgomery, a retired American rear-admiral who commanded a carrier strike-group
            in the Pacific. China had little to go on, he says, other than “History
            Channel documentaries” and occasional glimpses of American carriers—back
            in friendlier times when Chinese sailors were given tours of American
            ships. Even so, a carrier designed in the early 1980s, and another based
            on it, hardly represent the cutting-edge of sea power. “I don’t worry
            from a US Navy point of view,” says Mr Montgomery. “These are just targets
            for our submarines.”


            That is where the Type 003 comes in. CSIS reckons she is already 10 metres
            longer than her predecessors. She is likely to be the world’s largest
            non-American carrier for many years, says Rick Joe, who studies China’s
            armed forces, and “perhaps the most capable conventionally powered carrier
            of its era”. She will have a larger deck and room for more jets than the
            Shandong’s complement of around two dozen.


            More important than the ship’s size is the way that planes will take off
            from her. The runways of both the Liaoning and the Shandong, like those
            of Britain’s newest carriers, are curved at their ends like ski jumps,
            which limits take-off weight. The Type 003 is expected to have a catapult,
            a system currently used only by America and France. This would allow her
            to launch planes with more fuel and weapons—and not just fighter jets.
            The existing carriers rely largely on land-based aircraft for vital tasks
            such as monitoring by airborne radar, anti-submarine warfare and aerial
            refuelling. The Type 003 could accommodate such planes, and thus venture
            farther.


            The Chinese navy does not plan to stop there. It is widely assumed that
            the Type 003’s successor is being planned. It may be nuclear-powered.
            That would mark another step-change in capability. More fuel could be
            carried for planes, rather than for propulsion. The absence of a gas turbine
            would leave more room for weapons and cargo. A nuclear reactor could also
            power more potent catapults—ones that use electromagnetic induction motors,
            rather than steam—and, eventually, high-energy lasers for shooting down
            missiles.


            Mastering these technologies and learning the craft of conducting high-intensity
            air operations at sea will take years. American carriers can launch and
            recover waves of 10-12 aircraft more than a dozen times a day. The Chinese
            navy is far from matching this pace. Its planes are lightly armed, even
            compared with European counterparts, says Alessio Patalano of King’s College
            London. “I’ve yet to see a single picture of a Chinese plane taking off
            from a deck with a full payload,” he says.


            Yet the Chinese navy will get plenty of practice. America’s Indo-Pacific
            Command suggests that China will operate four carriers by 2025. British
            defence intelligence reckons that it may have as many as five by 2030.
            The expert consensus is that China plans eventually to build a fleet of
            somewhere between six and ten. That would put it within spitting distance
            of America’s fleet of 11, the world’s largest.


            American and Chinese carriers are unlikely to be pitted against one another
            at close quarters. They would be targeted by missiles launched from hundreds
            if not thousands of kilometres away, from sea or land, long before their
            jets would clash. “China would not deploy its carriers in the front line,”
            says Hu Bo of Peking University. But, in peacetime, carriers are potent
            symbols of power. America’s dispatch of two towards the Taiwan Strait
            during an escalation of cross-strait tension in 1996 is seared in the
            memory of Chinese leaders. And carriers could help China to defeat a weaker
            adversary. The Liaoning’s prominent foray into the South China Sea hints
            at things to come. Carriers extend a protective aerial bubble over the
            ships around them. That allows their whole flotilla to patrol farther
            with confidence. The future air wing of the Type 003 will be almost as
            large as the entire air force of the Philippines.


            And China’s sallies need not be confined to the Pacific—a large pier added
            this year to China’s naval base in the Red Sea port-state of Djibouti
            will allow Chinese carriers to dock there and thus make regular trips
            to the Indian Ocean. The Type 003 may be coming to a port near you. '

        title: Ferocious birth-control policies in Xinjiang are racially targeted
        text: 'W HEN CONFRONTED with uncomfortable facts, China’s usual response comes
            in two parts. First it tries denial and obfuscation. Should that not work,
            officials attack the motives of foreign critics. Arguments over Xinjiang,
            a far-western region that China runs with an iron fist, have reached this
            dangerous stage.

            In recent months America, Britain, Canada and European Union countries,
            among others, have voiced concerns about Xinjiang. They point to evidence
            that China has detained perhaps a million Muslims in re-education camps,
            notably from the 11.6m-strong Uyghur population, imposed sterilisations
            on ethnic minority women and forced villagers into factory labour. Chinese
            diplomats call such Western charges a shameless plot to slander China
            and frustrate its rise. State media hurl ad hominem slurs at foreign researchers
            who scour government documents, satellite images and open-source materials
            to expose abuses in Xinjiang, describing them as anti-China zealots or
            CIA agents. Chinese officials claim that Uyghur exiles who speak to foreign
            parliaments and news outlets are terrorists, or actors paid to tell lies.


            Such smears, though wild, have an impact. Behind closed doors in Beijing,
            it is not hard to hear Western diplomats and business types grumbling
            that rows over Uyghurs are disrupting trade deals and climate co-operation
            with China. Some mutter that reports from Xinjiang are surely exaggerated.
            It is increasingly easy to meet Chinese who treat foreign concern for
            the Uyghurs as a cynical attack on their country. On a recent reporting
            trip to Xinjiang, it was no surprise to be registered by police several
            times a day, and to be followed by plain-clothes agents in cars, on foot
            and on bicycles. For foreign journalists, such scrutiny there is routine.
            It was more startling, and revealing, to be asked “Do you like China?”
            by an official who had just escorted Chaguan off a packed train, ostensibly
            for covid-19 checks.


            Your columnist is not ready to abandon the notion that China and the West
            can agree on shared facts, even if they disagree on important principles.
            This Xinjiang trip was an experiment. The aim was to test the claim that
            Uyghurs are the targets of racist social engineering, using only government
            documents and interviews with officials and settlers from the country’s
            Han Chinese majority, who cannot easily be accused of anti-China sentiment.


            Three places were visited. Bachu, a county of cotton fields and fruit
            farms, is almost wholly Uyghur. Like many majority-Muslim areas in southern
            Xinjiang, it saw high birth rates not long ago. The county government
            reported a natural population growth rate in 2014 of almost 13 per thousand
            people. Using mortality rates for the surrounding prefecture, Kashgar,
            that figure equates to a birth rate of nearly 19 per thousand people.
            That is compatible with the average woman having perhaps three or four
            children during her reproductive years. Rural Uyghurs were allowed three
            children back then, and officials tolerated extra births to buy social
            peace.


            At a weekday lunchtime, the results of that fertility boom could be seen
            in Bachu’s main town. Watched by armed police—for the county saw deadly
            ethnic violence as recently as 2014—a sea of Uyghur children spilled out
            of primary and middle schools in uniform tracksuits and the red scarves
            of Young Pioneers. Passing stalls grilling meat and flatbread over charcoal,
            they greeted a foreign reporter in heavily accented Mandarin.


            Those same cheerful crowds alarm Chinese scholars. They write of young
            Uyghur populations exhausting southern Xinjiang’s water supplies, straining
            job markets and threatening stability in a border region. In 2017 Communist
            Party leaders ordered a campaign against illegal births, including cash
            rewards for locals who reported over-quota children. But legal births
            were also targeted. In January 2018 Bachu’s government boasted of controlling
            the population’s “excessive growth”. By 2017 the county’s birth rate had
            fallen from 19 to 13 per thousand, a highly unusual drop in just three
            years. Astonishingly, in 2019 Bachu reported a birth rate of 4.15 per
            thousand people. That is one of the lowest birth rates anywhere in the
            world, and a decline rarely seen even in wartime.


            Li Xiaoxia, a government sociologist in Xinjiang, has called reports of
            forced sterilisations “slander”. In an essay for state media in January
            she conceded that between 2017 and 2018, after the strict enforcement
            of rules, Xinjiang-wide births had fallen by 120,000 in a year. But Ms
            Li insisted that rural women from ethnic groups had “spontaneously” agreed
            to be sterilised. Some had taken rewards of 3,000 yuan ($460) or more
            for women willing to undergo tubal ligation before using their legal quota
            of children, she wrote. Others’ minds had been freed by officials “from
            the shackles of religious extremism”. She said Uyghurs and Han Chinese
            now followed the same rules, promoting “fewer and better” births.


            Not all pregnancies are equal


            Official documents tell a different story. Tiemenguan is a small town
            founded by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. The bingtuan,
            as this paramilitary enterprise is better known, was founded in 1954 to
            farm the region’s barren plains and bring in Han Chinese settlers. Last
            year the town advertised for auxiliary police officers, seeking young
            candidates of Han nationality, and promising to cover 10,000 yuan of medical
            costs if they were to have a second child. Wang Jian, a statistician from
            the bingtuan’s 6th division, is one of several scholars to recommend,
            in print, that the corps should encourage Han recruits to have more children,
            while limiting ethnic minority births. In a park in Shihezi, the largest
            bingtuan-run city, a father playing with two sons by a tree-shaded pond
            recalls how officials contacted him with a bonus for his youngest. A Han
            Chinese mother carrying her second child in her arms explains that his
            birth landed her a subsidy, extra leave and free milk powder. “They encourage
            you to have a second,” she says. The double standard should be glaring
            to admirers and critics of China alike. Facts are stubborn things. '

        title: Tourists flock to celebrate the history of the Chinese Communist Party
        text: 'ON JULY 1ST the Chinese Communist Party will celebrate its 100th birthday.
            The occasion has prompted a surge of interest in “red tourism”, involving
            visits to sites associated with the revolution that brought the Communists
            to power in 1949, and with the lives of Communist leaders. One of the
            best-known destinations is Jinggangshan in the southern province of Jiangxi.
            It is where Mao Zedong created the first rural base for the revolution
            in 1927. Another is Zunyi in the south-western province of Guizhou, where
            a crucial meeting cemented Mao’s control of the party in 1935. Many red
            tourists are retirees, who often wear caps displaying the Communist Party
            hammer and sickle or dress up in old-style Red Army uniforms. They frequently
            sing patriotic songs as they tour the sights. The party does not allow
            discussion of Mao-era horrors, such as the famine of the early 1960s that
            killed up to 30m people, or the brutal violence of the Cultural Revolution
            of the 1960s and 1970s. In the build-up to the anniversary, the party
            has waged a campaign against “historical nihilism”, meaning any grumbling
            about the party’s past.

        text: 'U NTIL CHILDREN reach the age of about 15 in China, education is free.
            So why is it that more than half of a typical family’s spending goes on
            it? The answer is cramming classes: a financial burden so great that it
            is often said to discourage couples from having children at all. Now officials
            are trying to rein in the industry, in part, it appears, to relieve the
            pressure on people’s wallets. Parents are not sure it will work.

            As many of them see it, cramming is not optional. Exams for entry to senior
            high schools are fiercely competitive. Then comes the dreaded gaokao:
            the university-entrance exam on which a child’s future hinges. But as
            the People’s Daily, an official newspaper, reported this month, the market
            for such services is plagued by “endless chaos”. It listed problems ranging
            from misleading advertising to high prices and the use of unqualified
            teachers.


            Officials began warning months ago that they were preparing to issue regulations
            to impose order. This sent shivers through the industry. According to
            Bloomberg, several education firms suspended plans to list their shares.
            New Oriental, one of China’s biggest cramming companies, saw its share
            price on the New York Stock Exchange drop below $8, from a high of more
            than $19 in February. On June 9th the education ministry said a new government
            department would be set up to oversee such businesses, encompassing both
            online tuition and lessons in the classroom.


            The industry’s growth has been rapid. One firm, Zuoyebang (“help with
            homework”) says it offers live-streaming classes to more than 170m active
            users each month. But officials fret about the social impact. They want
            couples to have more children—the birth rate is the lowest in decades
            and China is ageing fast. They also say that schoolchildren are overstressed.
            Urban pupils attend cramming classes for more than 10 hours a week, according
            to Deloitte, an accountancy firm. There is widespread speculation, including
            in state media, that the new rules will impose limits on when firms can
            offer tuition. They may, for example, prohibit classes after a certain
            time in the evening, during the summer holidays or at weekends.


            Some analysts think the government may have another motive. Many of the
            companies are offshoots of China’s tech giants, including Alibaba and
            Tencent, which have come under regulatory scrutiny this year for dominating
            markets and expanding into finance and other areas. Targeting the cramming
            business could be another way of clipping their wings.


            Parents wonder whether they will benefit. Some fret that the new rules
            will leave them with no choice but to use private tutors, which could
            prove even more costly. The resentful parent of a secondary-school pupil
            in Beijing blames the Communist Party: “It’s very simple. They just have
            to control everything, always.” '

        title: At 54, China’s average retirement age is too low
        text: 'A T ABOUT 54, the average age of retirement in China is among the lowest
            in the world. This is a problem. Since standards were set, life expectancy
            has soared while the number of working adults—those whose labour, in effect,
            supports retirees—has begun to shrink. But persuading people that they
            should work longer is proving hard. In 2008 the government said it was
            mulling the idea of raising retirement ages, but backed away amid a public
            outcry. Now it feels it can wait no longer.

            The pressure to act is evident. Current retirement ages were set in the
            1950s, when the average person was expected to die before reaching that
            stage. For most men in China the age is 60, much lower than the average
            of 64.2 in the OECD , a club mostly of rich countries. For female civil
            servants the age is 55; for blue-collar women it is 50.


            Yet life expectancy in China is now just two years short of the OECD average
            of 79, so a Chinese retiree on a state pension usually needs several more
            years of support from government funds than his or her rich-world equivalent.
            In 2019 the public-pension system covered almost 1bn adults, more than
            any other such scheme in the world. The country’s main pension fund may
            run out of money by 2035, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, an official
            think-tank, has warned.


            The government appears not yet to have decided how to reform the system.
            The current five-year economic plan, a 142-page document that was approved
            in March, contains merely a sentence on the topic, calling for adjustment
            in “small steps” and “flexible implementation”. But its inclusion means
            that changes are all but certain to begin before the plan expires in 2025:
            the government rarely announces a goal that may not be attainable.


            Officials say retirement ages will be lifted in stages, a few months at
            a time. China’s main state-run news agency, Xinhua, said two possible
            approaches were being considered. One would raise the retirement age for
            both men and women to 65, with the age for women being raised faster so
            that both reach the end point simultaneously. The other method would involve
            first raising the retirement age for women to 60, and then both sexes
            advancing to 65 at the same pace.


            Since the government revealed that the five-year plan would call for older
            Chinese to work longer, social media have reverberated with debate about
            the idea. On Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, posts tagged with “postpone
            the retirement age” have received 620m views and launched more than 100,000
            discussions. Many comments have been critical, with some blaming the country’s
            draconian one-child-per-couple policy for exacerbating the population’s
            ageing. (The limit was increased to two children in 2016, and will soon
            be raised again, to three.) In 2020 a survey of 96,000 people by a newspaper
            in Wuhan found that more than 80% opposed later retirement. They wondered
            whether they would have the stamina to keep working into their 60s, and
            also whether—if not in a secure job already—they would still be employable.
            Firms often discriminate against older people when recruiting.


            Concerns about the possible impact on social stability may explain why
            the government’s plans have kept slipping. In 2008 it hinted that reforms
            would begin in 2010. They didn’t. In 2015 a senior official said a detailed
            plan would be revealed in 2017. Again, no show. The government does not
            always pay much heed to public opinion when shaping policy: the one-child
            restriction was never popular. But in this case it may worry about angering
            a large number of people in urban areas where it is especially keen to
            prevent unrest (the one-child policy was most resented in the countryside).
            Most farmers carry on working until they are forced to stop by poor health:
            a rural pension scheme was introduced in 2009, but it provides far less
            support than urban residents enjoy.


            Lifting the retirement age is a bit more popular among government employees.
            Of almost 170,000 respondents to a survey conducted in 2016 by China Youth
            Daily, an official newspaper, more than 80% said delaying retirement was
            more favourable to government employees (presumably because such people
            are considered less likely to be fired for becoming older and therefore,
            as is commonly imagined, less energetic). One civil servant told Xinhua
            his boss had doctored his own records to make his age appear younger.
            “This way, he holds onto power longer,” the bureaucrat said.


            But young workers grumble about raising the age. They suspect they will
            have to wait longer for promotions as older workers occupy jobs for longer.
            Online, they use a common idiom to describe such seniors, accusing them
            of “squatting on the toilet without taking a shit”. In reality, lifting
            the retirement age will be harder on older workers who may struggle to
            retain their jobs when so many of their younger peers are far better educated.
            And concerns about job insecurity, especially as they get older, are pushing
            more young people to apply for jobs in the civil service.


            Raising retirement ages may create another problem. China’s fertility
            rate (the average number of children a woman can expect to have in her
            lifetime) is among the world’s lowest. On May 31st the Communist Party
            said married couples would be allowed to have three children to help the
            country “cope” with its ageing. (In 2018 the share of people over 60 was
            almost one-fifth; by 2050 it will be more than one-third.) But many families
            rely on grandparents for child care. When parents retire, the probability
            that their child gives birth increases by between 44% and 61%, says a
            study by Fudan University. If grandparents have to work longer, the government
            will have to spend more on kindergartens and introduce rules to force
            employers to make better provisions for working parents. Grappling with
            China’s demographic woes will involve many tough reforms.

        title: Hong Kong’s liberal media are under pressure
        text: 'Editor’s note (June 23rd 2021): Apple Daily, Hong Kong’s last pro-democracy
            tabloid, confirmed that it would publish its last issue on June 24th.


            S INCE CHINA imposed a national-security law on Hong Kong a year ago,
            restrictions on the city’s media have sharply escalated. The latest clampdown
            came on June 17th when police arrested Ryan Law (pictured), the chief
            editor of Apple Daily, an outspoken pro-democracy newspaper. Also seized
            were the tabloid’s publisher and three other bosses associated with it.
            They have been accused of violating the new law by conspiring to collude
            with foreign forces. “We value freedom of the press,” a senior officer
            said afterwards. Many journalists see no sign of that.

            Following the arrests, hundreds of police raided Apple Daily’s offices.
            They reportedly searched for journalistic materials, including laptops,
            notebooks and mobile phones. The government called it a “crime scene”:
            it says the newspaper’s assets have been frozen. This grim spectacle was
            little surprise. Apple Daily has long been in the sights of China’s ruling
            Communist Party. Its owner, Jimmy Lai, is rare among local tycoons for
            his outspoken criticism of the party. He was arrested last year for his
            involvement in a prolonged series of anti-government protests in 2019
            and could face life in prison under the security law. Chinese state television
            has called Apple Daily “a platform for incitement” of troublemakers. Many
            of the newspaper’s staff believe it is a matter of time before it has
            to close.


            Over the past decade, Hong Kong has plummeted from 54th to 80th in the
            Press Freedom Index published by Reporters without Borders, a campaign
            group. It still ranks higher than mainland China, which is fourth from
            bottom at 177th, just above North Korea. The city also lacks the mainland’s
            draconian internet controls. But the political climate in Hong Kong has
            changed dramatically since the central government imposed the security
            law.


            Editors now worry whether the content they handle could be in breach of
            the new law. Footage of rallies held on June 12th in dozens of countries
            to mark the second anniversary of the outbreak of the protests went unaired
            by big broadcasters, says Chris Yeung, the chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists’
            Association. The law’s ripple effect was also evident in the case of Claudia
            Mo, a pro-democracy politician who was arrested under the new bill in
            January. In May the High Court denied bail to Ms Mo, saying statements
            she had made to foreign journalists disqualified her. That sent a signal
            to reporters that they could get interviewees in trouble by quoting them.
            “I didn’t become a journalist for my stories to be used in this way,”
            says a reporter who has recently resigned.


            Apple Daily has always prided itself on being provocative. But other,
            less fiery, media have also been suffering. Take the city’s public broadcaster,
            Radio Television Hong Kong ( RTHK ), which long boasted an independent-minded
            culture inspired by that of the BBC . In February RTHK ’s English-language
            radio station stopped its night-time relay of the BBC World Service. Its
            Cantonese talk channel ditched a weekly broadcast of an hour-long BBC
            news programme in that language. This followed China’s decision to ban
            the airing of BBC shows on its territory because of the British broadcaster’s
            coverage of abuses in Xinjiang.


            It is clear that Hong Kong’s government wants RTHK on a tighter leash.
            In March it installed Patrick Li, an official with no background in journalism,
            as director of broadcasting. Since then, several senior editors have resigned,
            reportedly because of concerns about editorial freedom, and popular programmes
            that poked at officialdom have been axed. So, too, have television documentaries
            containing references to the protests in 2019. Their topics included police
            behaviour during the unrest and mask shortages during the pandemic, as
            well as subjects far removed from politics: one was about whales, another
            about hip-hop bands (someone interviewed about the whales had mentioned
            the protests; one of the bands was anti-government). In May RTHK did not
            renew the contract of a journalist who is renowned for putting tough questions
            to politicians. Also that month staff began deleting archived shows from
            Facebook and YouTube, including investigations about the protests that
            had garnered millions of views.


            The South China Morning Post, the territory’s main English-language newspaper,
            still has leeway to criticise the party. In 2015 it was bought by Alibaba,
            a Chinese e-commerce giant, which said it wanted to combat alleged anti-China
            bias in the foreign media. That sparked fears it might become a party
            mouthpiece. But the Post still often reports on human-rights abuses in
            China and other politically sensitive topics. Former staff say it is more
            cautious about subjects the party considers utterly taboo, such as corruption
            involving serving leaders and their families.


            Journalists in Hong Kong wonder how long it will remain possible to publish
            anything that is highly critical of the party. The central government
            is reportedly preparing to set up a department in Hong Kong to run “propaganda”.
            Many reporters fear this could mimic the role of the party’s Publicity
            Department in Beijing, which is in charge of censorship. In March Xia
            Baolong, China’s chief of Hong Kong affairs, lamented that in the media
            and other spheres, “patriots” were not yet fully in charge in the territory.
            To China, that means people who love the party.


            Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, appears unsympathetic to reporters’
            complaints. She says officials are mulling a law against “fake news”,
            a term they use to describe coverage they dislike. At her press conferences,
            Mrs Lam increasingly chooses to take questions from China’s state media.
            In an annual survey of local reporters conducted in May by the Hong Kong
            Journalists’ Association, more than 90% of respondents said press freedom
            had hit a record low. About 85% of them blamed the city’s own government.


            Some media workers are as gloomy about their readers as they are about
            curbs on freedoms. They say demand for punchy journalism is diminishing
            as citizens grow disillusioned with politics. “Many of us now wonder,
            what is the point?” says one reporter. “The Communist Party is going to
            do what they want to do.” '

        text: 'A MERICAN AND Chinese officials often talk of expanding the array of
            weapons they have to confront one another. China studies its opponent’s
            moves and responds in kind. America is learning from its adversary, too.
            On June 12th the White House said that America and members of the G 7
            would launch a scheme to help finance infrastructure, such as roads and
            bridges, in poor countries. The plan, dubbed Build Back Better World (
            B 3 W ), is an explicit counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (
            BRI ), a programme that began to take shape in 2013 with many of the same
            goals.

            Competition with China has dominated Joe Biden’s agenda since he took
            over as America’s president in January. His administration has promised
            to use “all available tools” to push back against what it describes as
            China’s unfair trade practices. The B 3 W plan takes aim at a global initiative
            closely associated with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Although
            BRI does not have a central planning body, more than 100 countries that
            are in need of infrastructure have signed up to it. The initiative has
            been criticised for burdening poor countries with unsustainable debts.
            But it has helped to strengthen bonds between China and the developing
            world.


            B 3 W would offer financing for cleaner projects, in contrast to some
            of those backed by China, which include coal-fired power plants that contribute
            to global warming. America’s vague plan notes that projects will be developed
            in a sustainable and transparent manner—a dig at the opacity common in
            BRI contracts. It will also mobilise private capital where China has mainly
            used state-owned firms.


            The idea appears half-baked. It is not clear whether Mr Biden or other
            G 7 leaders will be able to extract substantial additional funding from
            their governments. The White House says it will work with Congress to
            “augment our development finance toolkit”. Yet Mr Biden is still struggling
            to get Republican votes for spending on domestic infrastructure. It is
            not even evident that the plan involves much more than the rebranding
            of projects that are already being considered. These include numerous
            green infrastructure schemes in poor countries that were promised as part
            of the Paris climate agreement of 2015. Easing this backlog will be costly.


            Increasingly, China and America are replicating each other’s munitions.
            Days earlier, on June 10th, China’s legislature passed a law that allows
            the government to take action against individuals and companies for complying
            with other countries’ sanctions against China. America and the European
            Union have hit China with various punitive measures because of its mistreatment
            of ethnic Uyghurs in the western region of Xinjiang and its demolition
            of freedoms in Hong Kong. Donald Trump barred investment in several firms
            with links to the Chinese armed forces. His successor, Mr Biden, has doubled
            down on those rules by strengthening the legal foundations of the sanctions.


            China’s new law says the government can seize the assets and block the
            transactions of firms complying with American or EU measures against China.
            Unlike the European Commission’s statute on foreign sanctions, which prohibits
            compliance with them, the Chinese law does not explicitly make such activity
            illegal. Instead it is intended as a deterrent that provides the authorities
            with a legal means to impose countermeasures, say state media.


            The competing regimes put multinational firms in a bind. Fund managers
            have been attending webinars on how to navigate increasingly complex American
            and Chinese sanctions, says Kher Sheng Lee of the Alternative Investment
            Management Association, an industry body. Companies have had little choice
            but to follow American sanctions. China’s new bill could make that choice
            more difficult.'

        title: China’s climate sincerity is being put to the test
        text: 'T O HEAR CHINA’S Communist Party tell it, the nifty thing about autocracy
            is that it lets rulers plan for the long term. Apologists for one-party
            rule hail China’s leaders as enlightened technocrats who think in centuries,
            while decadent Western democracies struggle to see beyond the next election
            cycle.

            By the autocrats’ logic, China should excel at tackling climate change.
            For it faces stark long-term risks. As an arid country that lacks clean
            water and productive farmland, and where the richest regions lie on the
            coast, China is exceedingly vulnerable to global warming and rising sea
            levels. Sure enough, the supreme leader, President Xi Jinping, seems to
            be taking charge. Last September he decreed that China’s emissions of
            CO 2 will peak by 2030 and that by 2060 the country will become carbon
            neutral. A China-wide emissions-trading system goes live this summer.
            Vast wind farms and arrays of solar panels have been built, and more are
            coming.


            In fact, Chinese climate policy is a mess of contradictions. Perhaps time
            will show that Mr Xi is serious about making the unpopular, expensive
            changes that are needed to wean his country off fossil fuels, notably
            the coal that supplies nearly 60% of the country’s energy. But it is difficult
            to be sure. China’s coal consumption has risen significantly since it
            joined the Paris climate agreement in 2015. At home, a ban on new coal-fired
            power stations was lifted in 2018. The total capacity of such plants approved
            for construction or being built is larger than America’s entire active
            coal-fired power sector. Overseas, despite pleas from America, the European
            Union and others, Chinese development banks lend billions of dollars each
            year to build coal-burning plants, though a state-owned giant, the Industrial
            and Commercial Bank of China, says it will phase out coal financing.


            Provinces and cities, especially in the coal-reliant north-east, are hesitant
            about publishing carbon “peaking plans”. They want more time to pursue
            growth before curbing greenhouse gases. The rules governing the emissions-trading
            scheme have been loosened so that only a handful of plants will face real
            constraints, at least initially. This reflects the leading role apparently
            granted to the main economic planning agency, at the expense of the environment
            ministry, in bodies charged with deciding how, and how fast, to tackle
            climate change. Some big steelmakers have been allowed to expand production
            again, months after they were caught breaking environmental rules and
            ordered to cut emissions.


            Climate-related efforts in China are not always as mysterious or prone
            to sudden reversals. Take the China operations of foreign multinationals.
            Responding to consumers and politicians back home, many such firms have
            promised to make their global businesses carbon neutral, and to seek big
            cuts in emissions from their supply chains. As a result, the China bosses
            of some well-known European companies have told officials, including in
            the north-eastern cities of Tianjin and Shenyang, that they will find
            it hard to expand or open new production sites if the electricity or heating
            on offer locally continues to come from coal. “In an energy-intensive
            industry, if the electricity is coal-based, you can’t build a new plant,”
            says Harald Kumpfert of the European Union Chamber of Commerce’s branch
            in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning province.


            The largest taxpayer in Shenyang is a BMW joint venture that makes 600,000
            cars a year at two plants. In 2016 the city had no green electricity to
            sell. Now a new wind farm in Liaoning—a blustery coastal province with
            huge potential for green energy—provides about two-thirds of BMW ’s power.
            More energy comes from solar panels built over car parks where vehicles
            await delivery. On a recent visit, Chaguan was shown technologies that
            have cut carbon emissions per vehicle by 84% since 2016, such as cleverly
            controlled ovens in the paint shop. In a nicely dramatic touch, freshly
            baked car bodies emerge on a raised conveyor that carries them on a bridge
            through an office building, on their way to assembly lines.


            Alas, hundreds of BMW suppliers in China have “huge trouble” obtaining
            renewable electricity, say engineers at the car firm, suggesting that
            the foreigners have snapped up most green energy on offer. To avoid simply
            shuffling dirty energy around and to increase demand for renewables, energy-intensive
            Chinese suppliers, such as steelmakers or aluminium foundries, need to
            start installing efficient technologies and using low-carbon energy. Progress
            also requires changing the incentives that guide officials. BMW makes
            the case to governments that “jobs using renewable energy are sustainable
            jobs,” says Johann Wieland, head of the carmaker’s main China business.


            Long-term plans, short-term incentives


            China’s political system, for all its multi-decade plans, is run by officials
            who may stay in a given job for five years, and whose next promotion depends
            on economic growth now. Zhang Lei, the chief executive of Envision, a
            big wind-energy and battery company, is confident that top-down orders
            can overcome local inertia. “The most important thing is that President
            Xi has made a huge commitment and continues to push that agenda,” says
            Mr Zhang.


            Ma Jun, an environmentalist, sees a role for pressure from above and below.
            He runs the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, an influential
            Beijing-based organisation that tracks and publishes pollution and emissions
            data. “It is too much to expect a foreign company to change the energy
            mix of a city,” says Mr Ma. But nudges from foreign and local businesses
            might push officials to a tipping point. “To change minds we need both
            market-based and policy-based interventions,” he says.


            Multinational corporations are not saints. Many were happy to run profitable
            but dirty plants in faraway places. Too many are still reluctant to demand
            transparency from suppliers. But Western voters are growing serious about
            the climate, and about holding governments and businesses to account.
            That pressure might just be helpful in China. Pluralism is messy but potent
            stuff.

        title: The anti-graft unit of China’s Communist Party has grown in power
        text: 'A T MIDNIGHT ON June 1st Shi Zhaoqing, a local boss in China’s new
            anti-graft super-ministry, was working late on a case in the central city
            of Qianjiang. It was coming to a head; his team was exhausted. But before
            leaving the office he told the duty officers that investigators had to
            play by the rules, according to an admiring official account. “We must
            use the correct procedures to collect evidence and handle the case in
            a civilised manner,” he said.

            The Communist Party is trying to polish the image of its feared internal-investigation
            arm, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection ( CCDI ), which
            handles cases of corruption and political disloyalty. In 2018 the CCDI
            —though keeping its separate identity—became the core of a new super-agency
            called the National Supervisory Commission. For the first time the CCDI
            would operate within a legally constituted organisation and therefore
            be subject to law. This followed an announcement by China’s leader, Xi
            Jinping, that the party would abolish its secret interrogation system
            for party members. It was called shuanggui, meaning “double designation”,
            because suspects had to present themselves at a designated place and time
            for questioning. They were then held incommunicado, without access to
            lawyers.


            But it is becoming clear that rather than curbing its power, the party
            has given itself more. The new body is just as unaccountable and secretive
            as the CCDI itself (indeed, the National Supervisory Commission is, in
            effect, just a different name for the CCDI ). The new commission is drafting
            rules to supplement the law that created it. Taken together, these legal
            documents dramatically expand the jurisdiction of the party’s graft-busters
            and contain loopholes that allow them to behave much as before. Not surprisingly,
            there is no mechanism for public scrutiny of the new commission’s activities:
            no one watches the watchmen. One concession the new body has made is to
            gather public comments on the draft rules. The deadline for submitting
            these is June 15th, but it is unlikely that the commission will make them
            public, let alone revise the regulations in response.


            The rules allow the commission to investigate anyone who exercises “public
            power”. That includes civil servants, head teachers, hospital managers
            and bosses of state-owned firms. The remit is so broadly worded that it
            could apply to staff of foreign firms that have government contracts or
            joint ventures with state-owned businesses, says Jeremy Daum of the Paul
            Tsai China Centre at Yale Law School.


            By giving the commission such vast powers, outside the normal justice
            system, the party can keep a wide range of misconduct and abuses of power
            from public view and continue to work with minimal legal restraint, says
            Mr Daum. But the party insists otherwise. It says it is making its procedures
            fairer by tightening the rules. The shuanggui interrogation system has
            been replaced by one with a more obvious meaning: liuzhi, or detention.


            Unlike its predecessor, liuzhi comes with legal stipulations: audio and
            video recordings must be made of interviews, and any death in custody
            must be reported to the commission’s headquarters within 24 hours. There
            has been a push to build “standardised” interrogation rooms with padded
            fittings. Rules say detainees should be held no longer than six months,
            their “ethnic customs” should be respected and they should be provided
            with proper food, rest and medical care (there must be a first-aid kit
            to hand). At a glance it sounds, as Mr Shi might put it, very civilised.


            But suspects still have no right to a lawyer and no way of complaining
            about any abuse except to the new commission. In May 2018, two months
            after the organisation was established, a 45-year-old man who had worked
            as a government driver died while in liuzhi. His sister told Caixin, a
            news publication, that when she arrived to get his body, she found his
            face had been “disfigured”. The family asked in vain to see the interrogation
            video. Internet censors swiftly blocked Caixin’s report from circulating
            on Chinese-language forums.


            The way the CCDI has gained more power fits a pattern under Mr Xi. Since
            he took over as party leader in 2012, he has been trying to put the party
            more firmly in control of all aspects of state and society, while insisting
            that the party is also becoming more accountable. He has stressed the
            importance of law (in party documents, rule of law and rule by law are
            often used interchangeably), while using his investigators to target political
            enemies. Some of those detained by the CCDI have been accused of disobeying
            the party line as well as of graft.


            In 2018 Mr Xi launched a three-year campaign called “sweep away black
            and eliminate evil”. The targets were said to be organised crime syndicates
            and their accomplices in the party and government. But the dragnet swept
            up thousands of other people seen as threatening, including religious
            figures, leaders of rural clans and wealthy businessmen.


            Mr Xi’s purges have sown fear within the bureaucracy. That is their aim.
            Regulations issued in 2016 state that when being criticised or questioned,
            officials should be “red-faced and sweating”. Mr Xi says he wants them
            “not to dare to be corrupt”, “not to be able to be corrupt” and ultimately
            “not to want to be corrupt”. But making sure of that is the party’s task
            alone. “The party must manage the party,” he insists, repeating a dictum
            of its founders.


            The party shows no sign of relinquishing its power to toss those it finds
            threatening into “black jails”, as critics often call them. These facilities
            lack the trappings of the formal prison system, such as the need for a
            trial before incarceration and provision for visits from family members.
            The party’s “political and legal” committees, which oversee law and order,
            are particularly fond of using such lock-ups to detain people who petition
            against local injustices, as well as members of Falun Gong, a banned spiritual
            movement. In the far-western region of Xinjiang, these committees have
            led the creation of a new gulag to which the party has sent more than
            1m ethnic-Uyghurs without trial, purportedly for vocational training to
            help with their “deradicalisation”. (Most are Muslims who have shown no
            radical tendencies.) Some experts believe the authorities have begun to
            take some of the camps’ inmates and send them for formal trial, leaning
            on the courts to give them harsh sentences on dubious charges of extremism.


            The glowing account of the exploits of Mr Shi, the anti-graft boss in
            Qianjiang, describes how he instructed investigators to deal with a detainee
            in 2019. “Continue to increase the intensity of interrogation,” he says
            firmly. “And don’t let him lead you by the nose!” The suspect soon decided
            to co-operate and the case was cracked. The party always gets its man.

        title: China says it will be a “museum power” by 2035
        text: 'C HINA HAS big plans for the year 2035, if somewhat lacking in clarity.
            It will “basically achieve socialist modernisation” by then, whatever
            that means. Its army will be modernised, too. Late in 2020 it also said
            it would become a cultural and sporting power (isn’t it both already?),
            and an “education power” to boot. Last month it declared a new goal: to
            become a “museum power”. It even gave some detail. Between ten and 15
            of its museums, it said, would become “world-class”.

            China is building museums at a frenetic pace. In 2000 it had fewer than
            1,200 of them. By the end of last year there were nearly five times as
            many. Helped by a decision in 2008 to allow free entry to most government-run
            ones, visits have also soared. By the end of 2019 the annual number had
            increased more than fourfold, to 1.2bn. There was a huge drop last year
            because of the pandemic, but new museums still opened at a rate of nearly
            five a week (officials admit that obtaining enough good stuff to put in
            them is difficult).


            The new plan does not name any museums in the running for world-class
            status. But architecturally, several stand out. One is the Ordos Museum
            of local history, which opened in 2011 in the city of that name in Inner
            Mongolia. The huge amorphous blob, covered in polished metal tiles (pictured),
            is intended to evoke the dunes of the nearby Gobi desert. In Beijing the
            privately owned X Museum of contemporary art, which opened last year,
            is another that boasts a striking new building.


            But Chinese museums must be mindful of the Communist Party’s wishes. The
            plan for 2035 says the party must exercise “all-round leadership of museum
            development”. The document’s list of worthy themes for exhibits includes
            the Belt and Road Initiative—a global infrastructure-building project
            launched by China’s leader, Xi Jinping—as well as more universally acknowledged
            engineering marvels such as the Great Wall and the Grand Canal.


            Officials hope that museums will boost national pride and thereby support
            for the party. Two new museums have opened since 2018 dedicated to China’s
            claims to contested islands in the South and East China Seas. Last year
            the National Museum of China put on an exhibition about Taiwan, aimed
            at backing China’s assertion to sovereignty over that island as well.
            The same museum was the destination of Mr Xi’s first public excursion
            after he took over as leader in 2012. It was there he first used what
            was to become his most famous catchphrase, saying there was a “Chinese
            dream” of renewed national greatness.


            Occasionally, private citizens dare to open museums that explore sensitive
            topics. In late April feminists launched what they described as one on
            the theme of “internet violence”. It was really a work of protest art:
            a hillside dotted with 700 violent online messages that had been sent
            to Chinese women, displayed on red banners across a distance of three
            kilometres. Pictures of this were posted online, but the organisers kept
            quiet about where it was.


            Only in Hong Kong have museums been allowed that truly challenge the party
            line. But on June 2nd officials there closed a tiny museum dedicated to
            the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4th 1989. They cited
            a licensing problem. However, the move coincided with a ban on an annual
            vigil commemorating the bloodshed. In this case the pandemic was given
            as the reason, but many activists fear the massacre is becoming taboo
            in Hong Kong, just as it is on the mainland. The party’s all-round leadership
            of museums may be spreading into new territory. '

        title: Foreigners rush inside the Great Wall
        text: 'E ARLY LAST year, as covid-19 brought China to a near-halt for several
            weeks, multinational corporations caught a glimpse of a different kind
            of globalisation: one without a dynamic Chinese economy at its heart.
            Panic ensued.

            Foreign businesses confessed that they had grown too dependent on China
            as the easiest and best place to make and sell their wares, whether for
            export or in domestic markets. The new virus, coming on top of a trade
            war with America, was declared a salutary shock that would drive big changes.
            Foreign firms pledged to build more resilient supply chains by diversifying
            into other countries, while noting that they would keep production sites
            “in China, for China”, to serve Chinese demand when it returned.


            A year on, the mood is very different. Nearly 600 companies responded
            to an annual survey of business confidence conducted by the European Union
            Chamber of Commerce in China, which was published on June 8th. They described
            surging optimism about China, with economic growth having resumed far
            more quickly than expected. Three-quarters of European firms said that
            they were profitable in China in 2020, allowing them to send revenues
            back to headquarters suffering from dismal results elsewhere.


            Optimism varies by industry. In particular, makers of cars and luxury
            goods enjoyed bumper sales as affluent Chinese, denied holidays abroad
            by pandemic controls, went shopping instead. Fully 91% of the firms said
            they would maintain their investments in China, rather than move them
            elsewhere. Over a quarter of manufacturers are bringing supply chains
            more completely into China, five times as many as are moving them offshore.


            Strikingly, however, the same companies remain as sceptical as before
            that China will open markets or enforce regulations in the same way for
            local and foreign firms. The same share as ever, one-sixth, report being
            compelled to transfer technologies in order to maintain market access.
            Two-fifths say that the business environment in China is more politicised
            than before. That share would surely have been higher had the survey been
            conducted after recent Chinese sanctions on European politicians and the
            whipping up by state media of consumer boycotts against H & M and other
            clothing brands, in response to European criticism of abuses in the far-western
            region of Xinjiang.


            European companies report losing business opportunities because of laws
            that demand that sensitive technologies used in China must be secure and
            controllable by Chinese authorities. Those laws are buttressed by rules
            banning many data transfers across China’s borders. That is forcing multinationals
            to build duplicate databases, cloud services and software systems just
            for China, and to hire all-Chinese research and development teams. Increasingly,
            says the EU chamber’s president, Joerg Wuttke, firms must build one operation
            for China and another for the rest of the world.


            A cynical Chinese official might listen to these businessfolk grumbling
            about how tough it is in China, and wonder why, exactly, China needs to
            heed foreign calls to reform, when the same people turn round and make
            new investments. Such an official might even observe that some important
            European businesses are responding to American export controls on sensitive
            technologies by moving factories out of America so that they can continue
            to cater to Chinese customers.


            In private, European bosses concede that they have less and less leverage
            when trying to persuade China that it is in the country’s self-interest
            to open up. Some are growing keener to use sticks against Chinese business
            in Europe, such as investment-screening mechanisms or rules that would
            impose new costs on carbon-intensive projects or firms that are heavily
            subsidised by the Chinese state.


            The China led by Xi Jinping is selective in its welcome to foreign firms.
            The most favoured sell things that China cannot make for itself, such
            as high-tech chemicals and industrial machinery, and whose presence attracts
            specialist suppliers. Such firms enjoy red-carpet treatment: they are
            allowed to create Chinese subsidiaries which they own fully, helping them
            to protect trade secrets, and are spared red tape that entangles lesser
            rivals. A lower tier of foreign firms makes products that Chinese consumers
            like, such as fancy European cars. The state tolerates their presence
            as long as they make those things in China, using Chinese workers and
            components, and pay local taxes. That can be profitable: some multinationals
            earn almost half their revenues in China. But that is because they are
            operating entirely within the Chinese wall. China is not especially important
            as a market for Western–made exports: the EU sells more to Britain than
            to China, for instance.


            It is getting harder to bring foreign staff into China, particularly during
            the pandemic. Localising many jobs is a good idea: mediocre expatriates
            enjoyed unearned privileges for too long. But in a China steeped in angry
            nationalism, localisation also carries risks. Some Chinese executives
            take their government’s side over stalled reforms, or over political issues
            like repression in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Others have a tin ear for politics
            in the West.


            Putting the nation into multinational


            Boards in the West used to worry about things like market feasibility
            studies. Now they must wrestle with a new, philosophical question: do
            their firms really want to operate in China as Chinese businesses, employing
            fewer and fewer foreigners, to generate revenues shared with global shareholders?
            If such outfits ask their home governments in the West for help, will
            it be forthcoming? Experienced executives describe bleak choices. “It
            is about the weighing of risks,” says one. “The risks of not being here,
            with the risks of being here.” Meanwhile, public opinion in the West is
            turning more hostile to a China seen as grimly dictatorial. Diversification

            is decoupling. That shock will have lasting effects. '

        title: Uyghur groups want to take China to the International Criminal Court
        text: 'WHEN SALIH HUDAYAR visited Tajikistan in 2014, he remembers there being
            “thousands” of fellow Uyghurs in Dushanbe, the capital. Many of them came
            from the same city as him, Artush, in western Xinjiang. But since then
            the number of Uyghurs in the country has dwindled. Mr Hudayar is now an
            American citizen and the head of a group called the East Turkistan Government
            in Exile (ETGE), founded in Washington in 2004, claiming to represent
            the interests of Uyghurs in Xinjiang (or East Turkistan, as some Uyghurs
            call the region). According to evidence submitted on June 10th to the
            International Criminal Court (ICC), on behalf of the ETGE and the East
            Turkistan National Awakening Movement, another Washington-based group,
            China has been working with Tajikistan to round up and deport Uyghurs
            since at least 2016. The Chinese Public Security Bureau worked with the
            Tajikistan police to identify any Uyghurs, and then “directly intervened”
            to deport them back to China. “I knew central Asia wasn’t safe,” Mr Hudayar
            remembers. “No matter where you go, you have to be careful.”


            The lawyers for the two Uyghur groups are asking the ICC’s prosecutor
            to open an investigation into Chinese officials. They allege that through
            threats, intimidation and physical force, nearly 3,000 Uyghurs—85-90%
            of the total population in Tajikistan—have been compelled to return to
            China, where they are likely to end up in detention camps. The complaint
            argues that “these arrests, enforced disappearances, abductions and deportations
            form the first step of a continuum of alleged criminal conduct amounting
            to genocide and crimes against humanity”. There is no evidence of mass
            killings of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, but there are credible reports of extrajudicial
            detentions, torture, sterilisations, forced labour and many other horrors
            that could constitute crimes against humanity. Uyghur activists will see
            benefit if the complaint simply serves to discomfit China and draw international
            attention to its abuses in Xinjiang. But they are hoping for more. If
            the ICC’s prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, agrees that there is enough evidence
            of abuses happening in Tajikistan, rather than China, she may then apply
            to the court’s judges to open an investigation. But even that step would
            be a long way from actually convicting any officials in China.


            The problem for those trying to bring China to book for its abuses of
            Uyghurs and other minorities is that China, like America and Russia, is
            not a member of the ICC. Last year the court declined to open an investigation
            into China’s alleged crimes because it does not have jurisdiction over
            non-members. Now the lawyers say that they have gathered enough evidence
            of crimes in Tajikistan, which is an ICC member, to merit opening an investigation.
            The approach is a fairly novel one. The precedent was established only
            in 2019, when the ICC agreed to open an investigation into Myanmar, which
            is not a member, over allegations of crimes against humanity, because
            some of the effects of the atrocities were felt by Rohingyas in Bangladesh.
            As well as Tajikistan, the lawyers for the Uyghurs are gathering evidence
            of deportations from Cambodia and other ICC members to try and strengthen
            their case.


            Chinese officials involved in repressing Uyghurs will not be losing any
            sleep over the complaint, but the government will be displeased. Even
            the opening of an investigation would be significant, although the prosecutor
            will probably take months to come to a decision (last year’s request to
            investigate China was filed in July, and rejected in December). Since
            the court was founded in 2002, it has opened a mere 14 investigations,
            and secured only eight convictions, all of them of Africans. It is inconceivable
            that China would ever hand over its citizens to the ICC, although the
            court can issue arrest warrants that would in theory entrap suspects should
            they step foot in an ICC member state. But the government does not like
            to be criticised in international forums. When a tribunal in the Hague
            ruled in 2016 that China had “no legal basis” to claim disputed areas
            of the South China Sea, the government was furious. It has dismissed the
            ruling, but continues to argue that its claim on the waters is legitimate.
            “They don’t give a fuck, except that they do give a fuck, which is what’s
            interesting,” says Philippe Sands QC, who represented the Philippines
            in the South China Sea case.


            China is not alone in being hard to prosecute at the ICC. Some argue that
            the court infringes countries’ sovereignty, and America is loth to support
            an investigation into war crimes in Afghanistan, which the ICC launched
            last year. Ms Bensouda’s original request to open an investigation in
            Afghanistan was rejected in 2019 on the grounds “the relevant national
            authorities”, ie, America and Afghanistan, were unco-operative—a problem
            that would also apply to the China and Tajikistan case. But the ICC’s
            top judges overturned that decision in March 2020, setting a precedent
            that the court may be willing to proceed without the co-operation of the
            relevant countries. Should the Uyghur case ever reach a courtroom, the
            ICC will not try people in absentia; 13 people subject to its arrest warrants
            are still at large.


            But China’s influence in Tajikistan will make this a hard case to pursue.
            It is Tajikistan’s biggest creditor, and has taken control of much of
            the country’s border with Afghanistan. The importance of keeping that
            border secure means that Western aid is also likely to keep flowing to
            Tajikistan, notes Niva Yau of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a
            think-tank. Between 2005 and 2019 America invested more than $100m in
            strengthening Tajikistan’s border security, and is increasingly concerned
            about the border ahead of the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.
            The last thing that America wants is jihadists or Taliban loyalists spilling
            over from northern Afghanistan into Tajikistan and then into the rest
            of the world. Tajikistan knows this, and won’t fear consequences from
            the West if it doesn’t co-operate with the ICC.


            Under the Rome Statute, the ICC’s founding treaty, Tajikistan is obliged
            to co-operate with any investigation. But there have been reports of Uyghurs
            being detained there at China’s behest for at least a decade. It is unlikely
            to turn on its big brother, and as a Persian country, feels less solidarity
            with Uyghurs than other central Asian countries with Turkic populations,
            such as Kyrgyzstan, adds Ms Yau. Other countries in which the lawyers
            allege that Uyghurs were abused, such as Cambodia, have similarly cosy
            relationships with China.


            Uyghurs are well aware of the scale of the challenge. No one thinks that
            legal processes alone are the answer to China’s abuses. But an ICC investigation,
            if it happens, could strengthen the case for further economic and diplomatic
            responses, as well as giving victims their day in court. Some Chinese
            officials have already been hit with Western sanctions, and foreign companies
            are going to greater lengths to distance themselves from Xinjiang. For
            its part, the ICC has been irritating some powerful countries. Since its
            founding it has been accused of anti-African bias. But in recent years,
            it has been setting its sights elsewhere. In March this year, it opened
            an investigation into the situation in Palestine, much to the chagrin
            of Israel. The investigation in Afghanistan has annoyed the Americans.
            Going after China would give it another powerful enemy.'

        title: Hong Kongers try their best to remember Tiananmen Square
        text: 'FOR SEVEN weeks in 1989, China was convulsed by pro-democracy demonstrations
            that ended with the army’s killing of hundreds, if not thousands, of protesters
            in Beijing on June 3rd and 4th. In Hong Kong, then a British colony and
            a city that had long been considered politically apathetic, people watched
            on in horror. More than 1m people in Hong Kong attended each of three
            enormous rallies held in solidarity with the protesters in mainland China.
            Some travelled north, smuggling resources into Tiananmen Square in Beijing,
            the centre of the protests, and, after the crackdown, helping demonstrators
            flee the country. The events that unfolded in Beijing inspired the birth
            of Hong Kong’s own pro-democracy movement.


            Hong Kong has since been the only place on Chinese soil where officials
            have permitted a public commemoration of the tragedy of June 1989. The
            city was home to the world’s largest annual acts of remembrance, most
            prominently a candlelight vigil in Victoria Park. Every year tens, sometimes
            hundreds, of thousands of mourners would gather to remind themselves how
            different their city was from the mainland, where many still do not know
            what happened in 1989 because of government-imposed amnesia. Not any more.


            For a second year in a row, the Hong Kong government has banned the vigil,
            citing worries about the spread of the coronavirus. Many believe this
            is an excuse to clamp down further on their civil liberties, after a draconian
            security law was imposed on Hong Kong by the central government in Beijing
            almost a year ago. For several weeks, Hong Kong has had no local, untraceable
            covid-19 infections. Art fairs and sports competitions have gone ahead,
            with government approval. Yet anyone found participating in an unauthorised
            assembly faces up to five years’ imprisonment; those who publicise a public
            gathering face a year behind bars. Last year hundreds defied the ban.
            This year the authorities sealed off the park, blocked roads and deployed
            more than one-fifth of the city’s 7,000-strong police force to keep protesters
            at bay.


            On June 4th Chow Hang Tung, a barrister and human-rights activist, was
            arrested, accused of using social media to promote the banned vigil. Ms
            Chow is the vice-chairwoman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic
            Democratic Movements in China, the group that organised previous gatherings.
            She was one of six people arrested that day for participating in illegal
            protests or inciting others to do so. On May 30th an elderly democracy
            activist, Alexandra Wong (known as Grandma Wong), was arrested for allegedly
            attempting to incite others to take part in an unauthorised assembly as
            she marched, by herself, towards the central government’s representative
            office in the territory. A museum commemorating the massacre in 1989 run
            by the Hong Kong Alliance was forced to close on June 2nd after police
            said it lacked the correct operating licence. The group also cancelled
            an online vigil for fear it would be in violation of the security law.


            Pro-government politicians and groups in Hong Kong used mostly to avoid
            talking about the city’s annual remembrance ceremonies, afraid of provoking
            a public backlash. This has changed. A local news outlet interviewed establishment
            politicians who, in 1989, signed a petition in support of the student
            protesters. A pro-government politician has said calls for democracy in
            Hong Kong may violate the security law. After several churches said they
            would hold low-key services to commemorate the killings, banners with
            slogans such as “Churchgoers: be careful not to violate the security law”
            and “Evil cults have infiltrated religion” appeared in front of them.
            Government-friends organisations in Hong Kong previously only used the
            term “evil cult” to describe the Falun Gong religious sect.


            An unintended consequence of the ban has been to unite the city’s democracy
            movement and strengthen its ties to mainland activists. In the early 2010s
            attendance at the annual vigil shrank; many younger people rejected the
            perceived pan-Chinese nationalism and the idea of an emotional connection
            between Hong Kongers and mainlanders. A localist movement, promoting self-determination
            and political independence, emerged.


            But this year many who had previously called for boycotts of the vigils
            have changed their minds. After human-rights lawyers in mainland China
            last year defended young protesters from Hong Kong arrested in nearby
            Shenzhen, “I unexpectedly realised we have a connection with human-rights
            activists in China and we should become political allies,” Jerry Yuen,
            a prominent activist of localism in Hong Kong, wrote on Facebook.


            Many in Hong Kong marked the anniversary anyway. Despite deep police lines
            blocking access to Victoria Park, hundreds clad in black walked around
            its edge. Crowds in other parts of the city flashed their mobile-phone
            lights and shouted popular slogans from pro-democracy protests in the
            city in 2019. One man brought a pro-Beijing newspaper from 1989 to a park
            to read out its coverage about June 4th. The police subsequently searched
            him. The organisers of previous years’ vigils called on people to light
            a candle at home. The American consulate placed 400 electric candles in
            the building’s windows. A local artist, writing in a local newspaper,
            suggested people write “6-4” on light switches: “Think of this daily act
            of turning on and off the lights as a ritual and connect your present
            life to history”.


            “If anything, the government’s clampdown on this year’s vigil has just
            increased everyone’s desire to remember,” says a Hong Konger who, as a
            student 32 years ago, travelled to Beijing and was in Tiananmen Square
            during the crackdown. The sea of candlelight that illuminates Victoria
            Park each year may have been extinguished. Yet fireflies continue to flicker
            in the dark.'

        title: China will soon open a new stretch of rail across Tibet
        text: 'A S BIRTHDAY PRESENTS go, a 435km railway line that is expected to
            open this month in Tibet will be among the most lavish. To seekers of
            high-altitude thrills, it is one that will be cherished. The 37bn-yuan
            ($5.7bn) track extends from the region’s capital Lhasa eastward to the
            city of Nyingchi, which is Tibetan for “Throne of the Sun”. It is the
            region’s first electrified railway; its trains will be Tibet’s fastest.
            Officials call it a gift for the Communist Party’s 100th birthday, which
            will be officially celebrated on July 1st.

            But the new line is only part of what China calls the “project of the
            century”. This involves building Tibet’s second rail link with China’s
            interior at a total cost that state media say could be about ten times
            that of the Lhasa-Nyingchi stretch, with even greater engineering challenges
            yet to come. The section about to open was no pushover. Tunnels comprise
            nearly half of its length. Workers had to brave landslides, poisonous
            gas from broken rock, intense cold as well as an oxygen-starved atmosphere
            at more than 5,000 metres above sea level—roughly the altitude of Mount
            Everest’s base camps. When completed in 2030, the railway will connect
            Lhasa with Chengdu, the capital of neighbouring Sichuan province. At a
            maximum speed of 160kph, the journey will take just 12 hours, a third
            of the time now required by road.


            To the party, it appears no expense is too great in its campaign to integrate
            the vast, isolated region more closely with the interior. The first rail
            link, which opened in 2006, was also an engineering feat. Long lengths
            of that line from Qinghai province had to be laid over permafrost, using
            high-tech means to prevent temperature fluctuations from damaging the
            track.'

            It is therefore worth studying what China’s propaganda chiefs have in
            store for youngsters this summer. As usual, June 1st was marked this year
            in China as International Children’s Day, a festival of visits to museums,
            school picnics and wholesome games. A month later there will be a much
            larger event: celebrations on July 1st of the 100th anniversary of the
            party’s founding in 1921.


            China’s leader, President Xi Jinping, is presented to the young as “Xi
            Dada”, or “Uncle Xi”, an austere but caring patriarch. Mr Xi stresses
            the importance of loyalty, which is why children’s choirs are busy performing
            such songs as “Me and My Country” and “Follow the Leadership of the Communist
            Party of China”. Party history is being used to inspire the masses. That
            explains reports of kindergarten pupils being dressed up in miniature
            combat fatigues and told to crawl on their bellies while clutching straw-wrapped
            “rations”, to re-enact Red Army supply runs. There is much talk of China
            entering a “new era” of prosperity, national strength and global influence.
            It is not hard, as a result, to find children’s drawings on public display,
            showing high-speed trains and space rockets adorned with Chinese flags.
            The young are urged to be proud of ancient glories too, as heirs to what
            they are told is the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth.


            This year’s Children’s Day saw the release of a new patriotic film made
            especially for children. It depicts the pre-teenage life of Zhou Enlai,
            who was China’s prime minister from 1949 until his death from cancer in
            1976. This brilliant, disappointing man is a puzzle for historians. To
            this day, many Chinese revere Zhou as a moderate who tempered Mao’s worst
            excesses, especially during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. Too often,
            alas, the record shows Zhou enabling Mao’s follies and failing to defend
            close allies from political attack. Born in 1898 into a once-grand family
            of scholar-officials, Zhou was a precocious student of the classics. But
            his childhood was blighted by the deaths of his mother and adoptive mother
            and by money woes that, at the age of 12, forced him to leave his birthplace,
            Huai’an, in the plains between the Yellow and Yangzi rivers, to seek a
            new life with an uncle in the north.


            During the first decades of Communist rule, his privileged class background
            had to be explained away. A biography published in 1977, “The Early Life
            of Zhou Enlai” by Hu Hua, depicts Zhou as a “rebel against feudal society”,
            who as a boy came to hate the gentry class into which he was born. Deepening
            poverty turned him into a “great proletarian revolutionary”, it relates.
            That official history manages to praise Zhou’s traditional education while
            reflecting the party’s then-noisy disdain for pre-Communist codes of ethics,
            such as those taught by Confucius. Describing Zhou poring over books from
            his grandfather’s library, Hu asserts that the boy was stirred by histories
            of “laudable national heroes” fighting foreign invaders, but was uninterested
            in Confucianism.


            Biographies written in the 1990s by historians in the West, including
            Chae-Jin Lee, Barbara Barnouin and Yu Changgen, take a different view.
            They find that Zhou had a conventional Confucian education, which marked
            him for life. Nor do they agree that he was an angry rebel, noting his
            later, loving praise for his two mothers. Both were educated, tradition-minded
            daughters of scholar-officials. Indeed, they link Zhou’s survival at Mao’s
            side to a reverence for Confucian teachings about self-restraint and the
            need for officials to swallow small insults in the national interest.


            The new film appears to agree. Chaguan watched “Zhou Enlai in his Childhood”
            on Children’s Day in a cinema in Huai’an. The movie does not hide Zhou’s
            ancestral wealth. It portrays him as a solemn little boy in a silk gown,
            visiting relatives in antique-filled mansions. Confucian customs are shown
            as expressions of love. The young Zhou kowtows to his elders and studies
            cobwebbed texts to make his dying mother proud. His adoptive mother teaches
            him to swallow an unjust punishment with tales of an ancient general who
            endured humiliations on his way to greatness.


            The film is not fast-paced. There is much fidgeting in the cinema, though
            children perk up at a brief shot of a boy’s bare bottom, and again when
            Zhou urges his adoptive mother to drink ink as a medicine. The Zhou family’s
            struggles to afford a middle-class life are crafted to resonate with older
            cinema-goers. Zhou’s father, a petty official in another town, is depicted
            as a migrant worker—largely absent, always fretting about money, and emotionally
            distant from his own son. The film shows health crises that wreck family
            finances and trigger rows about whether to spend money on medicine or
            school fees. Such dilemmas remain common today. The film’s ending unites
            all ages. Over swelling chords, young Zhou waxes indignant on learning
            that Russia and Japan have taken territory from the ailing Chinese empire,
            then declares that he studies hard so that China may rise. That phrase
            of Zhou’s is taught in schools to this day, and triggers murmurs of recognition.


            Nationalism instead of class struggle


            After the film, a mother in the audience, Lu Ye, calls it “very educational”
            to see the orphaned Zhou confront debt-collectors, endure hardships and
            assume responsibilities beyond his years. Ms Lu’s 12-year-old son, Rongye,
            says that he “really liked” the film. He praises an episode in which Zhou
            picked and sold wild vegetables to help repay those debts, until his hands
            bled. “For the welfare of the family, he didn’t care,” Rongye notes approvingly.


            The film-makers say that their aim is to promote education and family
            harmony. China is a deeply conservative place, even as it prepares to
            celebrate its revolutionary past. Chinese children, told constantly to
            be diligent and obedient, sensed that all along. '

        title: China rapidly shifts from a two-child to a three-child policy
        text: 'F OR A GENERATION , China’s government had ordained that “one child
            is enough” for married couples. Then, in 2016, it allowed them to have
            a second. On May 31st the ruling Politburo declared that a further relaxation
            of birth-control regulations would help China to achieve its goal of “coping”
            with a rapidly ageing population—a pressing task. It called for a three-child
            policy. Some parents will respond with glee, but most will shrug.

            The government’s previous fears of galloping population growth now seem
            quaint. At 1.3, China’s fertility rate (the number of children an average
            woman is likely to have during her lifetime) is among the lowest in the
            world. Data from the latest decennial census, released on May 11th, showed
            that only 12m babies were born last year, a drop of almost 20% from 2019.
            It was China’s lowest population growth since the 1960s, when the country
            was reeling from a famine. The population now looks likely to peak in
            the next few years—almost a decade sooner than experts at the Chinese
            Academy of Social Sciences had, until recently, predicted.


            No indication was given of when the three-child policy will take effect.
            But it will not end young people’s growing disdain for baby-making. Reactions
            online—which on many topics tend to side with the Communist Party—brimmed
            with scepticism. “Do they not yet know that most young people are exhausted
            just supporting themselves?” said one netizen on Weibo, a Twitter-like
            site. “This policy is totally out of touch with the people,” wrote another.
            An online poll by Xinhua, a state news agency, asked whether people would
            consider having three children. Just 5% of respondents said they would.
            Most others said it was “out of the question”. At least 31,000 took part
            in the survey before it was hastily taken down. Netizens gave a new twist
            to a common idiom, minbuliaosheng, which means “people have no means of
            livelihood”. They used it to suggest that couples “cannot even speak of
            giving birth” (the characters are the same).


            For parents who do wish to have a third child, the change of policy will
            be a relief. Illicit births can incur a large fine or, in the case of
            civil servants, result in dismissal. Some women are put under pressure—illegally—by
            zealous local officials to undergo abortions if giving birth would cause
            a quota to be exceeded. With the three-child policy, the government is
            sending a signal that it is “moving very decisively to a pro-fertility
            policy”, says James Liang of Peking University. Mr Liang predicts that
            limits will “very soon” be scrapped altogether.


            That would be a huge blessing for those who crave large families. But
            any impact on the overall birth rate is unlikely to be a lasting one.
            When China loosened its one-child policy, it hoped for a baby boom. After
            a brief initial uptick, however, births drifted downwards again. The fertility
            rate edged up slightly (see chart 1). Mr Liang estimates that the three-child
            policy could boost the fertility rate to about 1.4, still well below the
            level of 2.1 which is required for a population to replace itself. Encouraged
            by decades of indoctrination, Chinese parents often feel—in cities as
            well as in villages—that a family’s resources are best devoted to one
            child. The high cost of housing and education, the burden of caring for
            elderly parents, as well as crushingly long work hours also deter young
            couples from having more babies, or from reproducing at all. As more women
            pursue careers, many are delaying marriage and motherhood. The Politburo
            said it would provide better child-care facilities, improve state-funded
            provisions for looking after the elderly, expand maternity benefits and
            lower the cost of education. It also promised to “protect the rights of
            women in employment”. It has been doing a poor job of it. In 2019 the
            government vowed to make more firms comply with existing anti-discrimination
            laws. These ban employers from asking women about their child-rearing
            plans in job interviews and from stating a preference for male applicants
            when recruiting. Offenders can be fined up to 50,000 yuan ($7,800). In
            practice, they are rarely punished. In a survey released in November by
            Boss Zhipin, a recruitment website, more than one in three women said
            that managers had immediately begun looking for someone to replace them
            permanently after learning they were pregnant. Some firms illegally force
            female recruits to sign contracts promising not to have children for several
            years. An image circulated by Xinhua of a poster promoting the three-child
            policy features two girls and a boy, probably to suggest that girls are
            good: a cultural preference for boys has encouraged sex-selective abortions
            and contributed to a highly unbalanced sex ratio. But some female netizens
            have noticed an irony. Lu Pin, a feminist who has been living in America
            since the arrest of fellow campaigners in 2015, wrote that by promoting
            larger families, the state was, in effect, trying to “exploit the unpaid
            labour of women”. The government has made no effort to encourage men to
            spend more time with their children.


            The Communist Party is in denial. It does not admit that its coercive
            efforts have been misguided since the one-child policy was launched in
            1979. Most of the fall in the fertility rate has been caused by urbanisation,
            education and the greater participation of women in the workforce. The
            same factors have caused similar declines in other countries with no brutally
            enforced birth quotas.


            The party may not want to abolish caps immediately. To do so would be
            to acknowledge error. It would also make redundant many of the hundreds
            of thousands of people who work for the fertility-control apparatus. And
            maintaining a limit could help the party to justify some of its abuses
            in the far-western region of Xinjiang. Ethnic minorities there, most of
            whose members are Muslim, once had higher birth quotas. In 2017 the government
            began a campaign of forced abortions and sterilisations among Uyghurs,
            even targeting women within their quota. Birth rates in Xinjiang plunged.
            The party fears a surge of births of people whom it regards as potential
            troublemakers.

        title: Education in China is becoming increasingly unfair to the poor
        text: 'A FTER XIONG XUAN’ANG gained the capital’s best score in China’s university-entrance
            exam in 2017, he was interviewed by Beijing’s media. The son of diplomats,

            top scorers now come from wealthy families,” he said. “It is becoming
            very difficult for students from rural areas to get into good universities.”
            His honesty drew much praise online.

            Since 1998, when China began a huge expansion of university enrolment,
            the number of students admitted annually has quadrupled to nearly 10m.
            About one third of high-school students now proceed to undergraduate courses.
            Data are patchy, but experts agree that the share of rural students at
            China’s best universities (the top 1%) has shrunk. Only 0.3% of rural
            students make it into them, compared with 2.8% of urban ones. Most other
            tertiary institutions are far inferior.


            Around the world, students from poor backgrounds struggle to compete with
            their richer counterparts. In China the divide is particularly stark.
            The main cause is the hukou system, which makes it very difficult to gain
            free access to state-provided services outside the place where one’s household
            is registered. This means that in cities, the children of migrants from
            the countryside are usually shut out of local state schools. They have
            to attend shoddy private ones that charge fees, or go to their parents’
            village for an education that is free but also bare-bones.


            The situation is made worse by the way that university places are allocated.
            The best universities are concentrated in the biggest and richest cities
            such as Beijing and Shanghai. They offer a disproportionate number of
            places to students with local hukou. China’s two most prestigious universities,
            Peking University and Tsinghua, are in Beijing. Their acceptance rate
            is around 1% for local students but only a tenth of that for applicants
            from places outside the capital, according to state television. More students
            from Beijing are admitted to Tsinghua every year than the combined number
            of successful applicants from Guangdong and Shandong. The population of
            those two provinces is ten times bigger than Beijing’s.


            In a paper published in 2015, scholars from Tsinghua and Stanford University
            said students with hukou in the poorest fifth of counties were seven times
            less likely than their urban counterparts to get a university place and
            14 times less likely to attend an elite one. In those counties, the odds
            were even more stacked against girls and ethnic minorities. “It is really,
            really clear that it is now much, much harder for a poor, rural kid to
            get into a good university,” says Scott Rozelle of Stanford. He estimates
            that around 75% of urban children go to university compared with 15% of
            rural ones. Nearly 80% of children under 14 have rural hukou. But writing
            in 2017, Wu Xiaogang, now of NYU Shanghai, a Sino-American joint-venture
            university, said less than 17% of students in elite universities had rural
            household-registration before taking up their places. The pattern has
            not changed since then, says Mr Wu. “If anything, it may be even worse
            now.”


            That is because inequalities in society are becoming more pronounced.
            The children of wealthy families have access to the best schools as well
            as to after-school tutoring and extra-curricular activities. Their parents
            can afford homes in good catchment areas. China offers nine years of free,
            compulsory education, but fees are levied at state-run senior secondary
            schools. In poor areas, charges can amount to more than 80% of net income
            per person, one of the highest such burdens in the world. Some students
            prefer to start work: a typical unskilled factory hand can earn in a month
            what a poor farmer earns in a year.


            The national university-entrance exam was suspended for the final decade
            of Mao Zedong’s rule. Since its relaunch in 1977, universities mostly
            have relied on test scores for admission. In 2003 China began to allow
            some universities to recruit students with special talents such as in
            sports and arts. Again, the wealthy have been the main beneficiaries:
            only they can afford to pay for the training needed.


            For decades state-funded feeder schools in poorer areas played a vital
            role in offering good students from the countryside a chance to get into
            university. But many have closed as a result of migration into cities.
            Meanwhile, competition has grown for places in good senior secondary schools.
            Ma Hang attended primary school in his home village. But the best junior
            high school in the county would not accept village students unless they
            paid extra fees or had powerful connections. His parents managed to use
            such a connection to get him into the school. He says that set him on
            a path that led him to a feeder high school and then to university.


            Rural children in China face obstacles at every stage of development.
            Babies are more likely to be undernourished and lack parental attention.
            By the time they enter primary school, many have ailments such as anaemia,
            poor vision and worms. Around 60% of students from the poorest counties
            suffer from at least one of these afflictions, says Mr Rozelle.


            Those who, despite the odds, make it to elite universities often feel
            socially isolated. In 2020 a student from the countryside took to social
            media to describe being “lost and confused” at university after leaving
            the “straightforward environment” of school, where passing tests was the
            focus. More than 100,000 students, many with rural backgrounds, weighed
            in, sharing their own experiences of feeling like misfits and lamenting
            their job prospects. They coined a new term in Chinese: xiao zhen zuotijia,
            meaning “small-town swot”.


            Wang Jianyue, a country-born physics whizz, can relate to their complaints.
            He chose to study finance at university, thinking it would be easier to
            find a job with such a specialism. It was only after he saw several of
            his classmates get internships at big financial firms using their parents’
            connections that he “truly understood the gap” between himself and them.
            Mr Wang changed his focus to computer science. Unlike some other small-town
            swots, he has, to his relief, got a job offer. '

        title: 'China wants to curb an old custom: the hazing of wedding couples'
        text: 'N ERVES ARE common in the run-up to nuptials. Couples in some parts
            of China must brace for torment. In a ritual called naohun, or “disturbing
            the wedding”, guests haze them. Often this involves forcing the man to
            strip to his underwear and don stockings or a bra. Friends then tie him
            to something and slather his body with sticky substances such as soy sauce
            and eggs. Firecrackers, taped to flesh, are sometimes set off; injuries
            ensue. Women can be targeted, too. Naohun allows people to kiss the bride
            and bridesmaids and even to grope them.

            Naohun rites were not always intended to humiliate. They began centuries
            ago with the aim of helping to put newlyweds—who often barely knew each
            other—at ease. Relatives would gently tease the couple in their bridal
            chamber, alluding to intimate acts. This served as a form of sex education.
            Rituals involving the groom’s father, such as making him carry his daughter-in-law
            on his back, were once cheered as a sign that she would be well-treated
            by her husband’s family.


            But in recent times, naohun has become an excuse to be rowdy, lewd or
            even physically abusive. In 2017 NetEase, an internet giant, found 142
            cases in the previous five years of hazing so outrageous that it had featured
            in stories in China’s media. Half of the incidents involved binding and
            beating. In 80% of them, grooms were the victims. Only five involved hazing
            of the bride, but cases of sexual harassment may often go unreported.


            The custom has faded in big cities but remains popular elsewhere. In the
            NetEase sample, the provinces of Shandong and Yunnan accounted for 60%
            of cases. The practice upsets the government, which wants to create “civilised
            cities”. Last year it called for an end to “unhealthy marriage practices”.
            These included naohun, “extravagance and waste” at parties and “sky-high”
            caili—cash given by the groom to the bride’s family. In April the central
            authorities designated 15 areas in ten provinces as pilot zones for wedding
            reform.


            Local governments have responded with a flurry of directives. In Inner
            Mongolia, in the north, weddings must now be hosted by local “red-and-white
            councils” run by Communist Party branches (red stands for weddings, white
            for funerals). In some provinces, newlyweds must sign a pledge to eschew
            “uncivilised” naohun. A county in Henan province has capped caili at 30,000
            yuan ($4,600)—less than a third of the going rate. Others have limited
            the size of banquets to 30 tables. Fines have been specified for rule-breakers.


            Even before the central government began its campaign, the city of Dali,
            a popular wedding spot in Yunnan, had begun stationing urban-management
            officers at well-known naohun locations. Yang Pinkang, a 26-year-old local
            who got married in October, had no naohun. “My friends were disappointed,”
            Mr Yang says. “But am I not meant to look my best for my wife on my wedding
            day?” He says residents have gone cool on naohun since the drowning of
            a groom who was thrown into a lake. Mr Yang recalls how his uncle set
            his aunt’s wedding dress on fire after friends dared him to crawl under
            it and light matches.


            No more such recklessness in Shandong province, officials hope. “Let us
            all be more polite,” one city there, Zouping, decreed in March. “Help
            weddings go back to being warm and romantic.” Consider it a marriage demand,
            not a proposal. '

        title: China’s revealing Afghan strategy
        text: 'O N MAY 9TH China’s foreign ministry was asked to comment on an atrocity
            in the Afghan capital, Kabul. Terrorists had detonated a car bomb outside
            a girls’ school, then two more bombs to kill pupils running for safety.
            At least 68 people had died, most of them children. The attack was aimed
            at girls from a Shia minority that is often targeted by Sunni Islamist
            groups, which have brought much misery to Afghanistan. Today such groups
            are jostling for blood-soaked advantage ahead of a full withdrawal of
            American forces, at the latest by September 11th this year, as ordered
            by President Joe Biden. China’s diplomats could have responded to the
            latest violence in several plausible ways.

            It would have been reasonable for the foreign ministry to tell the largest
            militant group, the Taliban, to rein in the mayhem, for China enjoys growing
            leverage over the Taliban’s leaders. That may seem counterintuitive. China’s
            foreign minister, Wang Yi, has expressed hope that future Afghan governments
            will embrace moderate Islam: an apparent rebuke of Taliban-style zealotry.
            Across the border, in China’s north-western region of Xinjiang, officials
            have demolished mosques and banned young people from public prayers. In
            all perhaps a million Muslims, most of them from the Uyghur minority,
            have passed through re-education camps in Xinjiang, set up to cure them
            of excessively religious or “backwards” thinking, and to turn them into
            biddable workers, loyal to the Chinese motherland.


            But the Taliban can be both fanatical and pragmatic, it turns out. Their
            leaders hope to rule Afghanistan soon, a quarter of a century after they
            first subjected the country to a reign of pious terror. Especially over
            the past three years, say scholars and diplomats in Beijing and other
            capitals, links between the Afghan Taliban and China have grown remarkably.
            Anxious for political recognition and economic backing from their giant
            neighbour, Taliban delegations have approved of Chinese plans to build
            motorways between Afghan cities. They claim to support a Chinese-funded
            project near Kabul to create one of the world’s largest copper mines,
            which has been stalled for years by concerns about ancient Buddhist ruins
            on the site and by fears of militant attacks.


            Privately, it is said, the Taliban have signalled that they do not care
            about Xinjiang. That relates to China’s main interest in Afghanistan:
            to prevent that unhappy country from sliding into chaos and becoming a
            haven or transit corridor for Uyghur militants who, China is sure, lurk
            in the region. Those fighters, China believes, include some with combat
            experience in Syria, some trained by Iran, and others who hope to enter
            Xinjiang through lawless tribal regions of Pakistan.


            It would have been reasonable, too, for China to have asked Pakistan to
            help stem the bloodshed. Pakistan is the Taliban’s patron, and has prodded
            the Afghan militants to establish ties with China. Pakistan likes to be
            useful to China, its most important sponsor. But the ministry chose a
            different response. After deploring the murder of the schoolgirls in Kabul,
            its spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, singled out America for blame. She charged
            that the “abrupt” announcement of America’s exit from Afghanistan had
            “led to a series of explosive attacks throughout the country”. She called
            on foreign troops “to pull out in a responsible manner and avoid inflicting
            more turmoil and suffering on the Afghan people”.


            This is a new criticism. Chinese scholars and state media have spent years
            accusing American forces of straying beyond their original mission to
            eradicate al-Qaeda and of spreading turmoil with their naive dreams of
            Western-style nation-building. More recently, they have asserted that
            America will surely leave behind covert operatives after its troops leave,
            in part to make trouble for China. In short, China believes that America
            has stayed too long in Afghanistan, is departing too hastily and is not
            really leaving at all.


            That line of argument is tangled enough. Making it more so, Chinese officials
            now call Afghanistan an area of possible co-operation with America, along
            with climate change and efforts to curb nuclear proliferation. When pressed
            for detail, including at a recent meeting with American counterparts in
            Anchorage, Chinese envoys are vague. A few years ago China and America
            did jointly train Afghan diplomats and police. These days China stresses
            the importance of its Belt and Road Initiative: how the infrastructure-building
            scheme can promote Afghan development and thus stability, such as by connecting
            the country to the sea via Pakistan.


            Afghanistan once saw remarkable co-operation. Early in the war on terror,
            President George W. Bush’s administration designated a Uyghur group, the
            East Turkistan Independence Movement ( ETIM ), as terrorists. Chinese
            agents were allowed to interrogate Uyghurs detained in Guantánamo Bay.
            They told one Uyghur he was lucky to be in American hands, since “as soon
            as they got him back to China, he was dead”, his lawyer later told Congress.
            Such joint action is unthinkable now: the two sides are so far apart on
            Xinjiang. In 2020 the Trump administration delisted ETIM as a terror group,
            expressing doubts that it still existed. China says it is a grave menace.


            To China, nothing matters more than stability'

        title: Chinese parents are keen on a more Confucian education
        text: 'A T FIRST GLANCE , Huaguoshan kindergarten in Zhuzhou, a city in the
            southern province of Hunan, looks much like any other nursery. Four brightly
            painted playrooms have buckets of building bricks and soft, coloured mats.
            But on higher floors, the classrooms are more spartan. Rice-paper lanterns
            and a row of black roof tiles running along the top of the walls evoke
            ancient Chinese architecture. Children wear powder-blue fleeces with the
            mandarin collars and frog fasteners of traditional jackets. Large portraits
            of Confucius hang on otherwise bare walls.

            The kindergarten opened in September but already has a year-long waiting
            list. It taps into a growing nationwide demand for guoxue, or “national
            studies”. This usually involves learning classical Chinese thought, texts
            and morals, especially those associated with Confucius. Children at Huaguoshan
            are taught how to bow, how to greet each other politely in the street
            and how to sit attentively, with back straight and hands placed carefully
            in their laps. In one room they noisily stamp leaves onto muslin bags
            to learn an ancient dyeing technique. In others they recite poems, practise
            calligraphy, perform tea ceremonies and play Chinese chess. But, say teachers,
            mastering skills is secondary to building character. A child learns to
            “respect her rival and accept defeat” in chess; in the tea room, to “value
            what is fragile as you would a porcelain cup”.


            After decades of worshipping foreign trends, many people are now interested
            in such traditions. Television shows include “Chinese Poetry Conference”,
            in which members of the public are quizzed on classical stanzas. Young
            people don traditional robes in public. At the heart of the trend is education.
            Frost & Sullivan, a data firm, estimated that the market for children’s
            guoxue education was worth 466bn yuan ($73bn) in 2018, almost double its
            value in 2014. Schools charge hefty fees. The organisation that runs Huaguoshan,
            a non-profit, also relies on donations. It promotes its educational philosophy
            on social media, with clips of its pre-schoolers reciting poems in traditional
            garb.


            Revered for 2,500 years, Confucius was vilified during the 20th century.
            Guoxue fans speak of “a hundred-year gap”. In 1905 the failing Qing dynasty
            abolished imperial civil-service examinations based on the sishu, the
            four Confucian texts. Modernisers saw the beliefs as blocking progress.


            The worst assaults were after the Communists came to power in 1949. During
            the Cultural Revolution, Mao exhorted people to smash anything old. Gangs
            of Red Guards swarmed Qufu, the sage’s hometown, and blew up his tomb.
            It was only in the mid-1980s, nearly a decade after Mao’s death, that
            the anniversary of Confucius’s birth could be marked once again.


            Top down, bottom up


            China’s return to tradition is driven in part by a sense of cultural loss.
            Many Chinese people are eager to rediscover their heritage, stripped away
            by decades of Communist rule. But it is also flourishing because it now
            meshes with official objectives. President Xi Jinping has done more than
            any other modern leader to elevate Confucian ideas. Soon after coming
            to power in 2013, Mr Xi visited Qufu, as emperors had done before him.
            He called for “new and positive roles” for Confucianism.


            The ancient system of thought emphasises respect for authority, reverence
            for ancestors and deference to elders. Confucius taught that such values
            were essential to achieve moral excellence as an individual. Such upstanding
            citizens would form the basis for wider social harmony and political stability.
            Emperors used the philosophy to instil obedience. Mr Xi wants to do the
            same. Party leaders also approve of Confucianism because, unlike socialism,
            it is home-grown. It appeals to young nationalists who cheer the party’s
            call for wenhua zixin, or cultural self-confidence.


            Strictly speaking, all primary and secondary students should be at state-regulated
            schools, though most kindergartens are private. Guoxue content, such as
            classical poems, has long been part of the state secondary-school curriculum.
            In 2014 more of it was added to the university-entrance exam. The number
            of classical texts to be taught in schools increased from 14 to 72. In
            2017 the government put out guidelines for having a comprehensive guoxue
            syllabus in primary and secondary schools by 2025. In May the education
            ministry confirmed the plans, saying it was important for young people
            “to be formed into upright Chinese” with the patriotism “to serve the
            country”. State-approved guoxue classes would “enhance a sense of belonging
            to and pride in the Chinese nation”.


            For many Chinese, the sage’s musings hold a different appeal. In neglected
            Confucian morals, educators see a set of values that may be a solution
            to modern social ills, just as some in the West turn to traditional Christian
            values. Jia Hong, who set up Huaguoshan and two other guoxue pre-schools,
            says, “Nowadays we hear about so much bullying and brattish behaviour.”
            Many think a lack of good manners is to blame. Three-quarters of the 200
            children at Ms Jia’s kindergartens used to attend regular ones. She says
            parents remark on how Confucian rituals have calmed their children and
            helped them focus.


            Many young parents believe that the national obsession with exams has
            distracted them from other forms of edification, says Cao Shenggao of
            Shaanxi Normal University. Some do consider the discipline instilled by
            guoxue, or mastery of the zither, say, as one more way to set their child
            apart in the educational rat race. Guoxue institutes often hint that their
            after-school classes can help boost test scores.


            But many others see guoxue kindergartens, which are legal, and guoxue
            primary and secondary schools, which operate in a legal grey area, as
            a way to shield children from relentless competition, at least early on.
            Scandals have spurred the government to crack down on the shadier end
            of such schooling. In 2019 a boy died after teachers at his boarding school
            refused to take him to a hospital, insisting on using traditional medicine.
            Last year the founder of a guoxue camp that claimed to cure internet addiction
            was sentenced to three years in prison, after pupils were found to have
            been abused. The government has also banned the teaching of “feudal dregs”,
            such as Confucian texts extolling female submission.


            Educators such as Ms Jia support the crackdown. But many popular guoxue
            schools for older children are keen to stay self-sufficient if they can,
            declining offers to work with local education boards. Tian Yu, a scholar
            of Chinese education based in America, finds that the schools appeal to
            certain parents as a way to avoid the political indoctrination of the
            state system. Guoxue educators say quietly that the revival of forgotten
            culture should come from the bottom up. But in a contest to define what
            counts as tradition, the party will always want to have a say. '

        title: How disgruntled Chinese people talk about you-know-who
        text: 'O N MAY 6TH Wang Xing, a Chinese tech tycoon, posted a classical ninth-century
            poem on Fanfou, a social-media platform. The poem mocked an ancient Chinese
            emperor who tried to quell unrest by burning books. “The ashes of burnt
            books had not yet faded away but the Qin dynasty was already weak,” read
            the poem. For some reason, cynics suggested that the dynasty Mr Wang had
            in mind was not an ancient one at all, and the “emperor” he was mocking
            was Xi Jinping.

            Mr Wang swiftly deleted the post, and censors wiped all comments. But
            the share price of Mr Wang’s firm, Meituan, a popular online platform
            for shopping and delivery services, promptly collapsed. In four days it
            declined in value by $26bn, wiping $2.5bn from Mr Wang’s personal fortune.
            He insisted that he had been referring to competition within the e-commerce
            industry. His firm is one of several that have come under recent close
            scrutiny from antitrust regulators.


            Open criticism of the most important man in China is taboo. Last year
            Ren Zhiqiang, a retired property tycoon and vocal critic of the government,
            published an essay about a speech by Mr Xi in which Mr Ren said he was
            not an “emperor” showing off his new clothes but a naked “clown”. Shortly
            afterwards, Mr Ren was sentenced to 18 years in prison for corruption.


            Even knocking lesser officials is risky. Jack Ma, the boss of Alibaba,
            another conglomerate, complained about China’s financial regulators last
            year. Authorities stopped the initial public offering of Ant Group, a
            fintech firm founded by Mr Ma, which would have been the largest ever.


            Others have been more careful. In April Wen Jiabao, China’s prime minister
            from 2003 to 2013, published a remembrance of his mother in a Macau newspaper.
            It included lines calling for a China “filled with fairness and justice”
            and “respect for human hearts”. Some thought he might be suggesting that
            fairness and justice were currently lacking. Censors pounced.


            Such is the current climate that even those who broadly support the government
            are sometimes nervous about mentioning Mr Xi’s name. Some employees at
            a state-run media group have taken to substituting the word “Trump” for
            Mr Xi in chat groups. At small social gatherings, people frequently stop
            short of uttering the name, even in the most benign contexts. They use
            instead phrases such as “you-know-who”, “big number one”, “the eldest
            brother” or “our big uncle”.


            When, at a recent private gathering that included diplomats, executives
            and bankers, the talk turned to Chinese politics, it was suggested that
            all switch off their mobile phones. No one thought it likely that government
            snoops were really listening in and no one had anything particularly controversial
            to say. But all agreed it was better to be safe.


            Electronic eavesdropping is not the only concern. The old-fashioned sort
            is also encouraged. Last month, the government launched a new system,
            with a website and hotline, for citizens to snitch on one another for
            making “harmful” political commentary. This can include “denying the excellent
            traditional Chinese culture, revolution culture and advanced socialist
            culture” as well as attacks on political leaders or their policies.


            In 2014 the Chinese and Japanese ambassadors to Britain each fancifully

        title: Why wealthy Chinese families recruit poor graduates as sons-in-law
        text: 'T HE LINGYIN temple in Hangzhou, a lovely, tree-shaded place, has long
            drawn those seeking the blessings of a good marriage or children. Pilgrims
            may still be glimpsed today. On a recent afternoon Chaguan watched a mother
            and daughter leave a tour group to pray, incense sticks held aloft, to
            a statue of Guanyin, a Buddhist immortal, before hurrying back to their
            guide.

            In centuries past, praying was all that many Chinese, especially women,
            could do, for they were powerless about much in their lives. Marriage
            was a transaction between families, not a love match. It led, almost invariably,
            to a woman moving into her husband’s home. There, her role was to give
            birth to heirs, meaning sons, and to care for his parents in their dotage.
            A woman could not own property and, once bridal payments and dowries had
            been exchanged, brought so few benefits to her birth family that married
            daughters were likened to “sprinkled water”. In cruel consequence, girls
            were often killed at birth.


            A few marriages were different. Since the Qin dynasty in the third century,
            a family without adult sons might recruit a poor but healthy man to “lend
            his strength” to their household as a live-in son-in-law. Some signed
            contracts agreeing to give their children their wife’s surname and to
            look after their parents-in-law before their own father and mother. Shocked
            by such breaches of filial piety, officials in the Yuan and Ming dynasties
            (between the 13th and the 17th centuries) banned men who were only sons
            from entering into such unions. Men who did faced widespread scorn. They
            were called zhuixu, or “mortgaged sons-in-law”, or, more politely, shangmen
            nuxu—“gate-entering sons-in-law”.


            Modern China is becoming more open-minded about what constitutes a good
            family, and with good reason. A national census unveiled on May 11th showed
            that China is ageing fast and has one of the world’s lowest fertility
            rates, so its population will soon be shrinking. Though the one-child
            policy became a two-child policy for most urban residents in 2016 and
            is set to loosen further, its malign effects will endure. Lone children
            must care for elderly parents without any help from siblings, which is
            one reason why many of them do not want offspring of their own. Because
            China is missing millions of women, lots of young men will never marry.
            Years of illegal, sex-selective abortions skewed China’s birth ratio.
            The census finds that 111 boys are born for every 100 girls.


            With fewer women, an optimist might imagine they would gain more power
            over whom they marry. There are other reasons why chauvinist traditions
            may fade. China is an increasingly urban, mobile country. Some 376m people
            live in a different city or town from the place named on their hukou,
            the household registration papers that limit where Chinese may live, work
            and obtain public health care or schooling. China is better educated,
            with over 200m university graduates. What is more, women students have
            outnumbered men on college campuses since 2009. In another change, families
            that own homes in larger cities have become wealthy after a decades-long
            property boom, especially if they bought apartments 20 or more years ago.
            Lots of those newly rich families have one child, a daughter, and—quite
            properly—are ambitious for her. The Beijing College Students Panel Survey,
            a big study, found that women students are more likely than men to come
            from affluent big-city families (and to study liberal arts). Male students
            are more likely to hail from poorer, provincial families and to study
            sciences or engineering, reflecting family hopes that they will land well-paid
            technical jobs.


            Predictably, it is not hard to find educated, urban women demanding more
            say over their lives. At the Hangzhou temple, Chaguan meets a fresh-faced
            couple emerging from the Guanyin shrine, and asks what they wished for.
            “I prayed we’ll endure the test of time, I don’t know about him,” replies
            Chen Jiajia, shyly scrutinising her boyfriend, Chen Jingsheng. Now 25,
            they met at high school in the southern province of Guangdong and have
            been together for seven years. Most women expect a man to own an apartment
            before marrying, Mr Chen said. That is a big pressure in a city as expensive
            as Guangzhou, where he works in information technology. A native of a
            small city, Meizhou, he lacks a Guangzhou hukou, another obstacle to buying
            property. Ms Chen has Guangzhou papers, and her family helped the couple
            to buy a flat. “They see potential in him, they think he is driven. If
            he weren’t, our parents would not support us in this way,” explains Ms
            Chen, who works in e-commerce.


            Less predictably, such social trends are bringing new attention to an
            old tradition, that of zhuixu. Li Jiyan, a matchmaker from Xiaoshan, a
            district of Hangzhou, specialises in finding graduates from poorer provinces
            to marry property-owning women from his city. His file-choked office is
            lined with framed photographs of him being interviewed by Chinese television
            stations and newspapers about the 1,000 marriages he has brokered since
            1999. Men on his books must be graduates of vocational college or university,
            earn 100,000 yuan ($15,540) a year and be taller than 1.70m. Crucially,
            they do not need to own property in Hangzhou.


            Never mind love, let’s talk apartments


            Mr Li is busy, fielding telephone calls from potential clients and turning
            away a young man who walks in but lacks a college degree. “Don’t give
            up,” he calls after the crestfallen youth. By taking in a poor outsider,
            families gain a biddable son-in-law and children bearing their mother’s
            name, he enthuses. He adds approvingly that “non-local boys” will take
            humble jobs, like riding delivery scooters, if graduate work dries up.
            Though he praises self-made men, Mr Li’s business model is really founded
            on inequality, a scourge of ancient and modern China alike. In a moment
            of candour, his wife once remarked that no home-owner would become a gate-entering
            son-in-law. The couple charge 15,000 yuan for two years’ matchmaking.
            If that fails, there is always prayer.'

        title: China is in danger of being humiliated at the winter Olympics
        text: 'I N 2018 THE Chinese men’s ice-hockey team qualified for the first
            time for the Olympic games, to be held in 2022 in Beijing, under a special
            dispensation for the host country. The cold reality of what this would
            mean was brought home last year when China was drawn in the same group
            in the competition as two powerhouses of the sport, Canada and America.
            A “slaughter” is likely, says China Sports Insider, a website. That would
            be a propaganda nightmare for the Communist Party, especially given the
            notable enthusiasm President Xi Jinping has shown for the sport.

            In 2014 Mr Xi told an interviewer in Sochi, Russia, that ice hockey was
            his “favourite” winter sport to watch. Ice hockey also features most prominently
            in an official video about Mr Xi and the 2022 games. At one point he tells
            a group of young ice-hockey players that China’s “hopes are pinned on
            your generation”.


            Efforts to boost the current generation of contenders have not gone well.
            Kunlun Red Star, a Chinese-owned club competing in Russia’s ice-hockey
            league, was meant to help. Mr Xi and Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin,
            attended the opening ceremony at the team’s formation in 2016 (they also
            attended a youth ice-hockey event together in 2018, pictured). Red Star
            set out to solve Mr Xi’s problem by recruiting foreigners of Chinese descent,
            including veterans of America’s National Hockey League, to move to China
            and become eligible to represent the country in 2022.


            But Red Star and the state sports bureaucracy appear to have had a falling-out,
            and responsibility for the national team has been passed like an errant
            puck between the club and Chinese officials. The relationship grew frostier
            still in 2019 when a squad made up of Red Star’s weaker players annihilated
            the Chinese national team, 10-0.


            The International Ice Hockey Federation in Zurich, which granted China
            its spot in the Olympics, wants to avoid even more lopsided results in
            February. On May 8th René Fasel, head of the federation, held a call with
            ice-hockey officials in China, a spokesman says, to discuss “how best
            to prepare the Chinese team” for the games.


            The only realistic solution is for China to bring in the ethnic-Chinese
            players Red Star has already recruited. They are waiting in cities from
            Vancouver to Boston for the call to play. China would still be expected
            to lose at the Olympics, but avoiding humiliation would feel like victory.

        title: China’s football troubles reflect broader issues within the economy
        text: 'I T WAS A hot and sticky night for football. Because of covid-19 restrictions,
            the match was played at a neutral site, nearly three hours from Shanghai
            by car. Adding to the inconvenience, kick-off was at 6pm on a Monday.

            their beloved local side, Shenhua, battle the club from Hebei, a northern

            businessman.

            Cries of sha bi, a phrase not translatable in a family newspaper, rang
            out whenever the referee missed fouls that, for the fans, were plain to
            see. Cheers erupted when a Shenhua midfielder scored the equaliser with
            a perfectly struck last-minute penalty kick. The crowd’s passion would
            have been familiar to football fans anywhere. But the canvas on which
            it was painted—a league beset by financial chicanery and political meddling—was
            unmistakably Chinese.


            China can seem like an economic juggernaut. Leaders set lofty targets
            and funnel money to favoured industries, a potent recipe when combined
            with talented, driven people. Football shows a less flattering side of
            its system: how the top-down approach that has worked well to build bullet
            trains can fail in less predictable domains.


            The government has high ambitions for football, encapsulated by President
            Xi Jinping’s stated dream for China to win the World Cup some day. That
            day remains distant. The national team is ranked 77th in the world, behind
            tiny Curaçao. And domestic leagues, a crucial building block, are mired
            in mediocrity.


            To understand what has gone wrong, look at the Chinese Super League (
            CSL ), the country’s main football contest. Three months after winning
            its first-ever CSL title, Jiangsu Suning disbanded in February, tripped
            up by slowing growth and a more conservative political environment. The
            team’s owner, Suning, an electronics retailer, has been trying to pay
            down its debts, like other overstretched Chinese firms. Not long ago a
            football champion would have attracted buyers, even if bleeding cash.
            These days, though, few tycoons dare to acquire trophy assets. In all,
            more than 20 teams have left China’s professional leagues in the past
            two years.


            The economics of football in China are atrocious. Average annual salaries
            for players of $1.2m in 2019 put the CSL roughly in line with Ligue 1,
            France’s top division. But revenues in China are piddling, with tickets
            regularly costing as little as 50 yuan ($8). Guangzhou Evergrande, a club
            renowned for its profligacy, took in only a third of the 2.9bn yuan ($450m)
            that it spent in 2019.


            Moreover, most wages go to a few extremely expensive players, often imported
            from abroad, sometimes well past their prime. Carlos Tevez, a faded Argentinian
            star, described his spell with Shenhua in 2017 as a “vacation for seven
            months”, despite reportedly earning $40m. In the 1990s foreign clubs rarely
            gave their Chinese counterparts the time of day, says Joseph Lee, a powerful
            agent. Now, he says, they view China as “stupid” money.


            Why have teams burnt cash with such gusto? Partly it is about branding.
            Xu Jiayin, the billionaire behind Evergrande, a property developer, once
            said that owning a football club ensured that his company made the evening
            news at a fraction of the cost of advertisements. But China’s tycoons
            are not just targeting consumers. They see Mr Xi’s professed love for
            football as a way to connect with him. After he rose to power in 2012,
            Chinese money poured into starry European clubs, from Inter Milan to Manchester
            City.


            The past year has made clear that, far from appreciating their investments
            in football, Mr Xi and his advisers see them as a red flag. Companies
            including Fosun, Wanda, CEFC, TEDA and Guangzhou R & F were among the
            big spenders, and all have had their finances come under scrutiny. There
            is talk that some entrepreneurs overpaid for players or for clubs in order
            to skirt China’s stringent capital controls (the suggestion was that they
            had kickbacks paid into their accounts abroad).


            So the government has introduced tough new rules, a crackdown that parallels
            Mr Xi’s efforts to reassert control over the broader economy. Politically,
            there has been a push to induct more footballers into the Communist Party,
            much as private companies are pressed to set up party branches. And the
            Chinese Football Association has capped salaries at 5m yuan for Chinese
            players and €3m for foreigners. It also ordered clubs to drop corporate
            titles from their names. Guangzhou Evergrande has become Guangzhou.


            Ma Dexing, a football columnist, sees the restraints as progress. “Over
            the past 30 years professional football in China has been chaotic,” he
            says. Mr Lee thinks the changes have been rash. “It’s like half the building
            was good and the other half rotten, but they demolished it all,” he says.


            The new rules also display officials’ penchant for micro-management. In
            2017, to boost youth development, the football association required clubs
            to field an under-23 player for every match. Managers gamed that rule,
            substituting youngsters after as little as a minute. So the football tsars
            mandated that they must play for the whole match. “The narrative every
            year ends up being ‘How have the rules changed?’,” sighs Cameron Wilson,
            founder of Wild East Football, a website devoted to the Chinese game.


            For China’s national football team, the fundamental problem is not at
            the elite level but at the grassroots. In big cities there is little space
            for children to kick a ball around. A hyper-competitive education system,
            in any case, leaves them little time for play. Officials had hoped that
            glittering football academies would help. The world’s largest was opened
            by Evergrande in 2012 with 50 full-sized pitches. So far, though, none
            of its thousands of graduates has made the senior national team.


            The football association has also tried to identify promising players
            early in life, placing them in development programmes—an approach that
            works for table tennis and diving but does not translate so well to team
            sports. “You don’t need an under-15 national team. You need thousands
            of under-15s playing,” says Joan Oliver, former boss of Barcelona, who
            now owns Beijing Institute of Technology Football Club in China’s second
            tier.


            With qualifying matches for the 2022 World Cup coming up, the government
            wants short cuts. Over the past three years China has started naturalising
            foreign footballers. On May 10th it named five, including three Brazilian-born
            forwards, to its squad. Mr Xi has called for greater self-reliance in
            China’s quest for global power. Football is a stark reminder that it still
            needs foreign imports. '

            A decade ago, Miss Zhu (not her real name) might have joined a multinational
            firm. They pay well, and it was “cool to work for foreign companies, because
            that shows your international horizons, and you can travel all over the
            world”, she says over cappuccino at an outdoor cafe in Beijing. Five years
            ago, top graduates vied to join home-grown technology giants like Alibaba,
            Tencent or Huawei. In addition to high salaries, such firms had free-thinking
            cultures and seemed to respect young people, she explains.


            Today, the trends are changing again. China still wants foreign businesses
            for their know-how and dynamism, but their status “is definitely going
            down”, says Miss Zhu. Geopolitical distrust is bleeding into work relations.
            Chinese employed by foreigners have noticed that they never advance beyond
            middle management and are the first to be laid off in bad times, she claims.
            As for domestic technology firms, their high salaries continue to attract
            the young. But they also face vocal criticism in Chinese media for domineering
            business practices and the “996” work schedules of their staff, toiling
            from at least 9am to 9pm, six days a week. In all, a third of Miss Zhu’s
            classmates took civil-service examinations. Some were hired by state-owned
            banks. Three joined technology companies. None joined a foreign firm.


            Chinese refer to securing an official position as shang an, or “landing
            ashore”, reflecting the security such jobs offer. In 2020, 1.6m people
            passed background checks to take national civil-service exams, 140,000
            more than the year before. Almost a million candidates eventually sat
            the exam, chasing 25,700 jobs. Still more took tests to become provincial
            and local officials. Many were fleeing a bleak market for new graduates,
            as covid-19 hit private firms.


            Miss Zhu says she joined an elite government ministry in search of meaningful
            work. She will soon spend two years as an official in a remote rural area,
            saying: “If you want to become a good policymaker, you have to go to the
            grassroots level.” A decade ago her parents would not have wanted her
            to join the public sector, she thinks. They distrusted officials, who
            routinely shook them down for bribes. Back then they would also have worried
            about her prospects as someone with no family guanxi, or connections:
            her grandfather was a farmer and her parents run a small business. She
            credits an anti-corruption drive that began in 2012 with changing their
            views of officialdom.


            Miss Zhu’s blend of ambition and idealism is a good fit with the times.
            Qiushi, a theoretical journal, recently published a speech that President
            Xi Jinping made in January to national and provincial leaders. He described
            “chaos” in the outside world, celebrated China’s new strength and declared
            that “time and momentum are on our side”. Mr Xi also identified risks
            for China, ranging from dependence on foreign technologies to political
            turmoil should “an insurmountable gap between the rich and the poor” appear.
            He told officials to study the Soviet Union’s collapse, after its ruling
            Communist Party became “a privileged bureaucracy that defended only its
            own interests”.


            Aware of public anger about inequality, Chinese propaganda has taken a
            populist turn, presenting the party as an ally against rapacious capitalism.
            In April authorities launched an anti-trust probe into Meituan, a food-delivery
            giant. Two days later Beijing Television showed a city official spending
            a day undercover, riding an electric scooter for Meituan. The exhausted
            bureaucrat told viewers that the work is “too difficult”, earning praise
            for his caring ways from the People’s Daily, a flagship party newspaper.
            Official media did not mention Chen Guojiang, a real-life Beijing delivery
            rider detained after posting videos of grim working conditions. He was
            charged on April 2nd with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”, a
            catch-all crime used against activists who challenge the party’s monopoly
            over questions of social justice.


            Miss Zhu admits that idealism is not the only reason to join the public
            sector. A brilliant classmate might have become a university lecturer,
            but instead took a post at a highly selective high school. She became
            a teacher because, years from now, she will be entitled to a school place
            for her (as yet unborn) child. To millions of hard-pressed parents who
            see education as their children’s only hope of getting ahead, such planning
            makes perfect sense.


            If you can’t beat ‘em…


            Other civil servants accept a low salary because of the heavily subsidised
            housing, health insurance and pension that go with it. Some small-town
            or provincial Chinese take on boring government jobs that come with hard-to-secure
            residence papers for such megacities as Beijing or Shanghai. A sense of
            filial duty prompted Wu Hong, an only child who graduated in 2008, to
            leave his software business in the boomtown of Shenzhen and return to
            his home province of Jiangxi. Mr Wu (not his real name) is now a poorly
            paid local bureaucrat. “My parents are getting old, and in my small town
            there is no better place to find a stable job,” he says.


            Off CN , an adult-education business, prepares millions of students each
            year for public-sector exams. It grew fast during the pandemic. “Training
            centres rose like bamboo shoots after rain,” says an Off CN manager in
            Beijing. He once looked down on civil-service jobs. Now he regrets missing
            the age limit—typically 35—for joining many government departments.


            Ordinary Chinese are often cynical about officials as a class, deeming
            them slow to help and quick to conceal mistakes. But for many in the private
            economy, just keeping heads above water is an exhausting slog. Small wonder
            some dream of heading ashore. '

        title: China pushes back against critics of its policies in Xinjiang
        text: 'N OT LONG before the Beijing Olympics of 2008, the Chinese government
            carried out a vicious crackdown on demonstrations in Tibet. Foreign media
            drew attention to it, and people outside China held protests. A Chinese
            academic popularised the idea of “three afflictions”: two that China had
            faced in the past (“being beaten” by foreign powers and “being starved”
            by poverty) and a third that it faces now: “being scolded” by the rest
            of the world. Later President Xi Jinping adopted the concept, arguing
            that China faces a “fight for international discourse”.

            On no subject has China been more scolded than Xinjiang, where it has
            interned some 1m Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic group, for such things
            as being too pious or talking to relatives overseas. Media in democracies
            uniformly portray this as a grotesque abuse of human rights. The Communist
            Party is pushing back, in an effort to break what it calls the “discourse
            hegemony” of the West. To treat the “third affliction” it has marshalled
            vast resources, including official media, think-tanks, diplomats and security
            organs, and spent billions of dollars over the past decade.


            A notable feature of recent propaganda about Xinjiang has been relentless
            attacks on China’s critics. In March the government imposed sanctions,
            such as bans on visiting or doing business with China, on elected officials,
            researchers and think-tanks in Europe and North America that had caused
            offence. Chinese officials also stirred up online nationalist boycotts
            of Western firms that had acknowledged the possibility of Uyghur forced
            labour in Xinjiang’s cotton industry.


            Since then authorities have made Uyghurs in China make videos begging
            their dissident relatives overseas to shut up; announced a lawsuit against
            Adrian Zenz, a prominent researcher into the abuse of Uyghurs; and harassed
            a BBC journalist, John Sudworth, into leaving China.


            The campaigns are getting personal. In April Xinhua, the official news
            agency, called Mr Zenz a “puppet of anti-China forces”. An entity called
            the Xinjiang Development Research Centre issued a report titled “Slanderer
            Adrian Zenz’s Xinjiang-related Fallacies Versus the Truth”. Global Times,
            a party tabloid, denounced Vicky Xu, an Australian researcher who has
            written about forced labour. It accused her of stoking sentiment that
            puts Chinese people in Australia “in peril”, and quoted a Chinese student
            who said she was “bewitched by the anti-China forces in the West”.


            In the past, when the party was accused of specific abuses, its propagandists
            would issue general denials. They would also try to recast repressive
            policies as examples of the party’s wisdom and munificence, producing
            what a vice-president of Xinhua once called “fairy tales”. And they have
            long tried to change the subject by playing up human-rights abuses in
            America. State media still produce fairy tales about happy Uyghurs doing
            traditional dances. But now, at almost any critical mention of Xinjiang,
            China pushes back hard.


            David Bandurski of the China Media Project, a research group in Hong Kong,
            says this verbal ferocity is partly aimed at a nationalist audience within
            China, which likes to hear the motherland robustly defended (as does Mr
            Xi). That helps explain a blustery performance by Yang Jiechi, China’s
            top diplomat, at a summit in Alaska in March with America’s secretary
            of state, Antony Blinken. After Mr Blinken raised the subject of Xinjiang,
            among other concerns, Mr Yang unleashed an 18-minute tirade about the
            virtues of “Chinese-style democracy” and the effrontery of those who try
            to “smear” it.


            A fragmented global media landscape makes it easier to spread disinformation.
            Conventional outlets are struggling financially, and conspiracy theories
            proliferate on social media and YouTube. China has spent hundreds of millions
            of dollars annually over the past decade to take advantage of this, expanding
            its media footprint abroad under a “Great Foreign Propaganda Campaign”,
            says a working paper for the Brookings Institution by Rush Doshi (now
            a China specialist on America’s National Security Council). He notes that,
            since 2009, Xinhua has doubled the number of its foreign bureaus to 200;
            China Radio International, a state broadcaster, has more than tripled
            its hours of programming in 65 languages; and China Global Television
            Network ( CGTN ) has established itself as a new brand overseas, with
            24 channels in five languages.


            Equally important have been state media’s deals to place content in other
            media outlets around the globe—what propaganda officials call “borrowing
            the boats to reach the sea”. China Daily paid handsomely to place inserts
            in such newspapers as the Washington Post and The Economist (though both
            ended the arrangement in 2020). Since 2018, Xinhua has struck content-exchange
            deals with print, radio and television outlets in Australia, Egypt, India,
            Italy and Nigeria, to name just a few, writes Sarah Cook of Freedom House,
            a watchdog. She adds that many consumers of these outlets may not know
            that some of their news (especially about China) comes from Chinese state
            media.


            The authorities in Beijing recognise that the most persuasive voices are
            not their own. They prefer to “borrow a mouth to speak”—promoting online
            the voices of useful foreigners, some of whom have made YouTube videos
            about their travels in Xinjiang, challenging reports of Uyghur suffering.
            A particular favourite is the Grayzone, an outlet that has sought to discredit
            the Western narrative on Xinjiang as a product of American imperialism.


            Perhaps unsurprisingly, the propaganda push does not appear to have won
            hearts and minds in rich democracies. But bullying critics may work in
            a way that is hard to measure—that is, in future silence. Many firms were
            quiet in the wake of the online boycott in China. The Better Cotton Initiative,
            a global apparel-industry consortium, took down an online statement of
            concern about Xinjiang cotton. In 2019, after an executive of a National
            Basketball Association team tweeted in support of protests in Hong Kong,
            China’s main broadcaster stopped showing NBA games. Since then, players
            and executives have been almost completely silent on China.


            “Not only Adrian Zenz, but all anti-China forces who attempt to inflict
            pain on Xinjiang through slanders must pay the price,” Xinhua wrote on
            April 30th. Such threats may cow some critics, but others will be emboldened.
            The new scold war could last a while. '

        title: Why so many young Chinese seek plastic surgery
        text: 'H ANNAH TANG , a company manager in Beijing, first went under the knife
            when she was 18. The surgeon made an incision across each of her eyelids,
            then stitched folds of skin back to transform her monolids into “double
            eyelids”. The result was eyes that look bigger, rounder, and in Ms Tang’s
            opinion, more beautiful. Now 35, Ms Tang (not her real name) has since
            had two more eyelid surgeries, as well as botox injections in her neck
            and monthly non-invasive “skin booster” treatments. “Pretty much everyone
            I know around me has had fillers or surgery,” she says.

            China’s cosmetic-surgery market is booming. Some analysts think it is
            now the world’s biggest. In 2019 the Chinese “medical-aesthetics” industry
            (which includes surgery, injections and skin treatments) had revenue of
            $27bn, around one-fifth of the global total, estimates Deloitte, a consultancy.
            It reckons the average annual rate of growth in China’s market between
            2015 and 2019 was 29%, compared with a global average of around 9%. By
            2023, Deloitte estimates revenue will reach $48bn.


            Figures can be vague partly because “there is a huge hidden market” that
            goes unreported, says Yi Wu of Maastricht University in the Netherlands.
            For example Dongguan, a city in southern China, has over 6,000 unlicensed
            clinics but only 43 licensed ones. The International Society of Aesthetic
            Plastic Surgery has not included detailed data on China in its global
            reporting since 2011.


            Starting young is common. In 2020 61% of patients were aged 16-25, up
            from 48% two years earlier. More than 90% are under 35, and 85% are female.
            In America, 81% of cosmetic-surgery patients are over 30 and nearly one-quarter
            are over 55. Ms Wu believes part of the reason young people have surgery
            is the influence of Confucian parenting, which means that children grow
            up without unconditional approval. This normally leads to academic pressure,
            she says, but it can also be internalised so that children feel the need
            to improve their appearance from a young age.


            Double-eyelid surgery accounts for half of all treatments. (In America
            breast augmentations are the most popular procedure, although in 2020,
            the year of Zoom, more Americans fixed their noses than their breasts.)
            Some say the desire for rounder eyes is about looking more Western. But
            women care more about achieving the “golden ratio” of facial proportions,
            a more Chinese requirement, reckons Joyce Xu, who works in marketing in
            Beijing.


            The golden ratio is an upside-down triangle: big eyes, relatively flat
            cheekbones, a narrow jaw and a small mouth. Ms Xu (also not her real name)
            started Botox injections to that end when she was 27.


            As middle-class incomes have risen, surgery has become more affordable.
            Ms Xu’s quarterly injections are 3,000-5,000 yuan ($460-770) each time,
            which she deems a bargain. However, the popularity of such things has
            led to widespread fakery. An estimated two-thirds of injectables in China
            are unlicensed. In February Gao Liu, an actress, shared shocking pictures
            on social media of her botched nose job. It resulted in the tissue on
            the tip of her nose dying and turning black.


            Horror stories such as Ms Gao’s may not slow growth. One consequence of
            starting on treatments so young is that your “baseline appearance gets
            forgotten,” notes Ms Wu. As a movie character almost said, there’s a great
            future in plastic surgery. '

        title: China wants the world to know that resistance to its rise is futile
        text: 'L EADERS OF CHINA and America share an obsession: the notion that a
            large enough coalition of Western democracies might have the heft to confront
            a rising China about its authoritarian, state-capitalist ways, and demand
            that it follow a new trajectory, one that does less damage to norms and
            universal values that have governed the rich world since 1945.

            China fears a broad, American-led coalition as the one force that might
            still be able to contain it. Not so long ago its foreign minister, Wang
            Yi, mocked the Quad, an informal group uniting America, Australia, India
            and Japan, as so much “sea foam”. After America hosted a Quad-leaders
            summit, China has called the group a destabilising scheme to build an
            Asian NATO . The Trump administration expanded the role of the Five Eyes,
            an intelligence-sharing pact between America, Australia, Britain, Canada
            and New Zealand. The group issued a statement in November 2020 about the
            crushing of political freedoms in Hong Kong. But the Five Eyes should
            be careful not to be “poked and blinded”, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman
            growled. Australia and Canada are being punished with trade sanctions
            and detention of their citizens to teach them the cost of helping America
            in disputes with China.


            Under President Joe Biden, American enthusiasm for coalition-building
            has only grown. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, explained to CBS
            News recently why America seeks allies to confront China’s government
            about repression at home and aggression overseas, as well as its adversarial
            approach to trade. “We’re much more effective and stronger when we’re
            bringing like-minded and similarly aggrieved countries together to say
            to Beijing: ‘This can’t stand and it won’t stand’,” Mr Blinken said.


            In fact, these two rival powers are obsessing about something that is
            not likely to happen. For one thing, America’s allies have few illusions
            that any group of outsiders, even one led from Washington, can tell today’s
            China what will and will not stand. As a Western diplomat in Beijing glumly
            notes, such countries as Britain, France and Germany “are close to accepting
            the inevitability of China’s rise”, and so are out of alignment with America.
            For another, lots of Western democracies are fractious and mistrustful,
            especially after four years of Trumpian bridge-burning. European and Asian
            democracies alike are wary of joining America in anything resembling a
            cold-war effort to check China’s aggression—especially if it jeopardises
            profitable trade relationships.


            France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said this year that it would be counter-productive
            for Western powers “to join all together against China”. The German chancellor,
            Angela Merkel, has also spoken out against the “building of blocs”. In
            recent telephone and video calls with President Xi Jinping and other Chinese
            leaders, there is no record of her raising sweeping sanctions imposed
            by China on European politicians and researchers, in retaliation for EU
            sanctions targeting officials accused of brutally repressing Muslims in
            the north-western region of Xinjiang.


            Official read-outs instead record Mrs Merkel talking of co-operation and
            praising a draft trade pact agreed with China last year, the Comprehensive
            Agreement on Investment, which would offer more access to China’s market
            for some EU firms, notably German carmakers. Ironically, the agreement
            may be doomed by the sanctions that Mrs Merkel wants to ignore. Those
            punished by China include members of the European Parliament, which must
            approve the pact. The EU trade commissioner, Valdis Dombrovskis, said
            on May 4th that efforts to finalise the deal are on hold.


            EU unity is further undermined by members with close investment ties to
            China, such as Greece. One member does not conceal its admiration for
            Chinese autocracy, charges a European diplomat in Beijing: “The EU has
            its traitor in the ranks: Hungary.” Nor is there consensus within the
            Five Eyes. In recent weeks, New Zealand’s government declared itself uncomfortable
            with the intelligence-sharing pact’s releasing geopolitical statements.


            China loves all such signs of disunity, praising European nations for
            seeking “strategic autonomy”, a French phrase that means not marching
            in lockstep with America. Yet in its paranoia about American-led alliances
            bent on containment, China risks missing a change that is actually happening
            in the real world.


            Even as they concede that the time for trying to change China is over,
            rich-world democracies are defensively China-proofing their economies
            and their societies. They are setting up new investment-screening laws,
            investigating whether foreign powers are meddling in their domestic politics
            and universities, and writing public-procurement rules to block bidders
            who raise national-security concerns. The EU is proposing new curbs on
            state-subsidised firms wanting to compete in European markets. Such policies
            do not always name China, but it is the target.


            Standing together, sort of


            Foreign ministers of the G 7 countries—America, Britain, Canada, France,
            Germany, Italy and Japan—met in London on May 3rd-5th. Their closing communiqué
            condemns Chinese abuses in Xinjiang, including “the existence of a large-scale
            network of ‘political re-education’ camps, and reports of forced labour
            systems and forced sterilisation”. The solutions offered are purely defensive,
            and make no pretence that the G 7 can change Chinese policies. The risk
            of importing goods made with forced labour will have to be tackled through
            “our own available domestic means”, the ministers say, by raising awareness
            and advising businesses.


            Such words do not frighten China. Confident in the power offered by its
            vast market, it hopes that foreign governments will hurry up and realise
            that resistance to its rise is futile. If resistance means forming blocs
            to contain China, then America’s allies already agree. But those same
            democracies are also channelling a growing distrust into defences that
            will introduce new frictions into relations with China. Friction is a
            form of resistance, too. '

        title: Even doveish China-watchers in America are becoming hawkish
        text: 'W HEN RICHARD NIXON made his historic visit to Beijing in February
            1972, he reassured Mao Zedong that neither of their countries had plans
            for global hegemony, meaning that they could work together and “find common
            ground, despite our differences”.

            Nixon’s trip marked a shift not just in America’s relations with China
            but also in the centre of gravity for analysis of the country in America.
            China-watchers moved towards a more doveish presumption that China did
            not pose a threat and a hope that engagement would mean it gradually becoming
            more like America. Nearly half a century on, the balance has shifted once
            again, towards a hawkish posture that, as in the cold war, stresses ideological
            competition. The relationship is as confrontational now as at any point
            in the 50 years since Nixon went to China.


            “It doesn’t take any bravery to be a China hawk today. It takes bravery
            to not be one,” says a former official who advised several presidents
            on China. He and many others see a desire for a new cold war in Washington.
            President Joe Biden’s officials, like President Donald Trump’s, talk of
            “strategic competition” with China, rather than co-operation.


            Both parties on Capitol Hill strike a similar tone. A bill called the
            Strategic Competition Act passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
            on April 21st, promising to “counter the malign influence of the Chinese
            Communist Party globally”. Analysts at think-tanks and in the media have
            written stratagems for containment and elegies for engagement.


            Expertise about China is not necessary. Within government, analysts who
            once focused on war zones have pivoted to China. Those who preach moderation
            towards the Chinese government risk being tarred by the most strident
            hawks as apologists, their motives called into question. Esteemed China
            specialists who were previously called on by the White House for advice
            have fallen out of favour.


            China’s own actions have prompted the pushback. In the past decade the
            Communist Party has intensified repression at home, ramped up military
            activity in its near seas and, with its newfound economic heft, pursued
            an increasingly aggressive foreign policy. Meanwhile Xi Jinping, China’s
            president, warned that China was engaged in an ideological struggle with
            the West, and that he would not tolerate dissent or unrest. His removal
            of term limits on his rule, the crushing of civil liberties in Hong Kong
            and the mass internment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang shocked many previously
            doveish analysts into hawkishness.


            Former proponents of engagement are often now the loudest cheerleaders
            for the change in tone. “It was an illusion that China would change if
            we just sent more ballet troupes, more foundations, more academic exchanges,
            more journalists, more trade,” says Orville Schell of the Asia Society.
            “The message, and this is what the academic community is starting to understand,
            is that Leninism, if you have had many decades of it, is deep.”


            Under Mr Trump, America’s national-security policy became focused on challenging
            China, by improving deterrence, especially in the South China Sea and
            the Taiwan Strait; by trying to stop Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant,
            from building 5 G networks around the world; and by rooting out Communist
            Party influence and espionage in America, subjecting an unknown number
            of academics and researchers with China links to scrutiny from the FBI
            .


            Mr Trump appeared personally inclined to court Mr Xi and overlook or even
            applaud his repressive impulses. Yet the Trump administration was the
            first in the world to impose sanctions on Chinese officials and companies
            for their complicity in human-rights abuses in Xinjiang (the Biden administration
            would later co-ordinate further sanctions with its allies).


            Dozens of American dissenters, including some prominent China scholars,
            pushed back in 2019 in an article in the Washington Post entitled “China
            is not an enemy”. They argued that America was exaggerating the threat
            from China as an “existential” one, and that its confrontational policy
            would weaken the hands of moderates within the Chinese government. On
            both counts their arguments were dismissed by critics as a rehash of engagement-era
            tropes, in particular the notion that there exists a meaningful pro-reform
            faction within Mr Xi’s Communist Party. The conversation about China in
            Washington remained unchanged.


            In the summer of 2020 four Trump officials gave a series of speeches describing
            the Communist Party as a threat to freedom and democracy globally. And
            in January the Trump administration became the first government to declare
            that the atrocities committed against Uyghurs in Xinjiang constituted
            genocide, a view the Biden administration has repeated but other countries
            have generally not. Mr Biden has adopted the Trump hard line, with less
            fire-breathing rhetoric, about the contest between authoritarianism and
            democracy.


            Public sentiment against China runs high, too, in America and among its
            democratic allies. Being tough on China will continue to be popular. What
            worries the moderates, and even some of the hawks, is how China will respond
            if it decides the Biden administration is, like the Trump administration
            appeared to be, locked in an adversarial struggle. The strategic rationale
            of Nixon’s opening to China was that they had an adversary in common,
            the Soviet Union. Now America and China are left only with each other.

        title: Is China’s population shrinking?
        text: 'Editor’s note (April 29th 2021): This article has been updated to include
            denials that China’s population is shrinking


            T HE COMMUNIST PARTY has long known that, partly as the result of its
            brutal birth-control policies, China’s population would soon peak and
            start to shrink. It has been startled, however, by how rapidly that moment
            has drawn near. Now, it looks as if it might have arrived.

            In November the country completed its ten-yearly census, and said it would
            announce the results in early April. As May arrives with no announcement,
            leaks suggest that the results have not been published because they are
            so shocking, and the party is in a flap about how to break the news. The
            Financial Times reported on April 27th that the census will show that
            the population has fallen below 1.4bn, still higher than the 1.34bn in
            the 2010 census, but lower than it was a year before.


            Leaks are sometimes wrong, or reflect early estimates which are revised
            upwards. Global Times, a party newspaper, denied the report in the Financial
            Times, saying census results are “extremely unlikely” to indicate shrinkage
            starting last year. Oddly, it said a result showing a lower population
            in 2020 than in 2019 is likely to be “a statistical error”. The paper
            also acknowledged that a decline is likely to occur by next year. On April
            29th, in a one-line statement, the National Bureau of Statistics said
            the population continued to grow in 2020. Either way, China’s demography
            is raising difficult questions for the party.


            In 2015 the government relaxed the one-child policy, allowing most people
            to have a second child. The birth rate briefly rose, but soon fell again.
            In 2019 the number of new sprogs was the lowest since 1961, when a Mao-made
            famine killed millions and the population was half its present size.


            A trickle of recent provincial data on birth numbers points in the same
            direction. Local figures on new birth registrations (separate from the
            census) offer a preview of what the census figures will probably show.
            For the first three quarters of 2020 the south-western city of Guiyang
            reported a 32% fall in births compared with the previous year. In the
            eastern city of Weifang births were down by 26% in the first half of the
            year. Hefty declines were reported elsewhere, unrelated to the coronavirus
            pandemic. There are also indications that China’s total fertility rate
            (the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime) has
            dropped faster and further than previously thought. Chinese planners have
            assumed a rate of 1.8, but some Chinese scholars (and the World Bank)
            say it is between 1.6 and 1.7. A working paper released in March by China’s
            central bank suggests the rate is no more than 1.5. Such numbers make
            grim reading for the party. China’s working-age population, defined as
            those between 15 and 59 years old, has been falling since 2011. Meanwhile
            the share of people aged over 60 has risen from 10.4% in 2000 to 17.9%
            in 2018. The latest guess is that by 2050 one-third of Chinese will be
            in their 60s or older. Supporting them will put a huge burden on the young,
            unless the oldies can be persuaded to work longer. In a report published
            in 2019 the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences warned that China’s main
            pension fund could run out of money by 2035.


            A second demographic worry is the continued imbalance between men and
            women. Since the 1980s birth restrictions, combined with a preference
            for boys and easy access to prenatal scans, led to the widespread abortion
            of girls. In 2019 there were 30m more Chinese men than women and the disparity
            in the number of marriageable age will only grow. The government worries
            that young men who cannot find a mate may become a source of unrest.


            Low birth rates will put more pressure on the party to abandon all its
            coercive birth-control policies. Fines still apply for having more than
            two babies, though enforcement varies. Lately the loudest calls for this
            have come from officials in the three provinces that comprise China’s
            north-eastern rustbelt. Birth rates in Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning
            are only about half the national average.


            In February China’s National Health Commission said those three provinces
            could start allowing people to decide for themselves how many children
            to have. That is a right people in other countries take for granted. But
            it is unlikely to boost the region’s overall birth rate, or its flagging
            economy. A sociologist notes that local youngsters are fleeing to parts
            of China with better weather and more jobs.


            “Most people want no baby or at most one baby, so even if you remove all
            the limits right now, it won’t have much effect,” says Zhang Xiaochen
            of Duke Kunshan University. Chinese have grown accustomed to the idea
            of a small family. High costs for housing, health and education further
            discourage fecundity.


            Child-rearing out of wedlock is both socially unacceptable and officially
            discouraged, even as young Chinese are delaying getting married or shunning
            it entirely. Last year the number of nuptials fell by 12% to a little
            over 8m, the lowest since 2003 and well down on the peak of 13.5m in 2013.
            In 2005 almost half of those who got hitched did so between the age of
            20 and 24; in 2019 only about one-fifth did so.


            Officials are keen on policies such as cash payments to encourage parents
            to have a second child. But evidence from the 50 countries trying to boost
            birth rates suggests that this is hard. Providing cheap child care is
            perhaps the most effective policy. But that is much more costly and complex
            to deliver than handouts.


            James Liang, an economist at Peking University, believes that China’s
            distorted demographics will limit the size of its market and talent pool
            and thus hinder its rise. China will never accept significant numbers
            of immigrants, he says, so America will have a big advantage. In the next
            ten or 20 years, China will continue to do well, but then America “will
            retake leadership and China will never catch up”.


            The falling birth rate will bring forward another battle. A new five-year
            plan includes vague proposals to increase China’s retirement ages, which
            in cities is currently 60 for men and 55 or 50 for women, well below the
            rich-country average of 64. That will be deeply unpopular. And lengthening
            working lives also risks driving fertility down further, because many
            families rely on grandparents for child care. There are no easy ways out.

        title: China blocks mention of Oscar-winner Chloé Zhao
        text: 'W HEN CHLOÉ ZHAO won Best Director for her film “Nomadland” at the
            Golden Globes in February, film buffs in China, the land of her birth,
            were ecstatic. State media proclaimed she was the pride of China. “Congratulations,”
            gushed Zhang Ziyi, star of “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”, on social
            media. “Look forward to the Oscars.” Two months on, however, as Ms Zhao
            became the first woman of colour to win an Oscar for Best Director, and
            “Nomadland” scooped Best Picture, her name was nowhere to be seen.

            What happened? The answer is a form of nationalist backlash that is increasingly
            common. Soon after Ms Zhao won the Golden Globe, internet-users dug up
            comments she had made in 2013, saying China is “a place where there are
            lies everywhere”. Censors pounced, removing any mention of her from the
            Chinese internet.


            Nationalist trolls have long been intolerant of speech they deem critical
            of China. The government is now endorsing these attacks, perhaps for fear
            of looking weak if it doesn’t. It has intervened to cancel the distribution
            of “Nomadland” in China.


            Ms Zhao is not the first to be dealt with in this way. In June last year
            Hao Haidong, a Chinese footballer who is the country’s top scorer and
            now lives abroad, said that the Communist Party’s rule “has caused horrific
            atrocities against humanity”. Chinese websites swiftly deleted his name.


            In 2020 Fang Fang, a writer who kept a diary throughout Wuhan’s lockdown,
            was read by tens of millions across the country. But once it was announced
            that an American publisher was translating her diary into English, she
            was labelled unpatriotic and faced an online onslaught. Her writing has
            been shunned by Chinese publishers and media outlets. “This is the trolls
            winning,” says Michael Berry, who translated Ms Fang’s work. “These attacks
            can escalate to the point they result in actual political decisions.”


            China also has a broader agenda: to promote homegrown movies and weaken
            American cultural dominance. The era of seeking validation from Hollywood
            may be over, says Ying Zhu of the City University of New York. And an
            increasingly rocky relationship with America is causing the Communist
            Party to be less obsessed with international awards. Nine out of China’s
            ten top-grossing films this year were Chinese. The Oscars, argued a recent
            newspaper editorial, are “still dictated by Western tastes and standards”.
            China, it said, should have its own awards ceremony.


            That may already be under way. Since 2019, China has banned all mainland
            film-makers from attending the Golden Horse Awards in Taiwan, formerly
            the leading Chinese-language festival, after one award winner called for
            Taiwanese independence. It even scheduled its own version, the Golden
            Rooster awards, on the same night, forcing film-makers to choose.


            The party’s treatment of Ms Zhao is a missed opportunity for the country
            to promote its soft power. As the relationship between America and China
            has worsened, bicultural, bilingual artists such as Ms Zhao could be providing
            an important bridge. In her acceptance speech, she spoke warmly about
            memorising Chinese poetry with her father as a child, and she switched
            into Mandarin to quote a famous line from classical Chinese.


            But the authorities have a long history of censoring Chinese artists,
            including “Fifth Generation” film-makers, such as Zhang Yimou and Chen
            Kaige. Mr Zhang’s latest film, “One Second”, was withdrawn at the last
            minute from the Berlin Film Festival in 2019 for “technical reasons”.


            In the end, as with all good movies, there may be room for redemption.
            After the Oscars, Global Times, a nationalistic newspaper, published an
            English-language commentary praising Ms Zhao for her warmth towards her
            Chinese roots and saying she could have a “mediating role”.


            Ms Zhao’s next film as director is “The Eternals”, a superhero movie from
            the Marvel franchise. Its producers will be hoping the film also does
            well in China, now the biggest market in the world. The fact that Ms Zhao
            is Chinese may have been part of her attraction to them. She is now looking
            more like a liability.

        title: Violence against doctors in China is commonplace
        text: 'P ATIENTS IN CHINA keep attacking their doctors. On January 27th Hu
            Shuyun, a physician in the southern province of Jiangxi, died after being
            assaulted on a ward. A few days earlier three medical workers at a hospital
            in Hangzhou, an eastern city, were injured when a patient set off a homemade
            bomb. Every month brings more shocking stories. Chinese even has a word
            for it: yinao, meaning “medical disturbance”. Between 2004 and 2016, the
            number of such disputes that ended up in court rose from 8,854 to 21,480.
            But only a fraction of cases get that far. In 2016 the National Health
            and Family Planning Commission acknowledged that it had mediated more
            than 60,000 disputes.

            The problem of yinao has become so acute that, on March 1st, Shanghai
            became the first city to start a blacklist of people deemed to have engaged
            in banned behaviour in medical facilities. As well as facing criminal
            penalties, they can be barred from holding public-sector jobs and denied
            access to outpatient services under the social-credit system, in which
            bad behaviour can mean loss of rights and privileges.


            These measures build on a national law that came into effect last June.
            It is the first to specify that citizens have a right to “basic health-care
            services” provided by the state. It also bans them from attacking medical
            staff. In July Beijing’s city government adopted its own guidelines for
            hospital security, recommending checks at entrances and surveillance cameras
            inside. On April 15th Beijing’s health commission said that 86 hospitals
            had installed facial-recognition systems.


            China’s doctors have long worried about violence. In 2015 600,000 physicians
            signed a petition calling for an end to such assaults. A survey in 2019
            found that 85% of doctors had encountered violence at work. Officials
            have hailed medical staff as heroes during the covid-19 pandemic, but
            at the height of the outbreak last year there were several reports of
            patients with the disease assaulting doctors.


            Much of the anger originates in the 1980s, when reform began on the free,
            state-funded health-care system. Hospitals, starved of government funds,
            began charging patients for treatment, and often resorted to overprescribing.
            Many ordinary people were unable to pay. This has created a “generalised
            sense of distrust” towards the medical profession, says Cheris Chan of
            the University of Hong Kong.


            Even though the government initiated further reforms in 2009, under which
            nearly everyone is now covered by some form of basic health insurance,
            the quality of care in rural areas is still poor. So people go straight
            to large city hospitals, many of which sell tickets for consultations
            that touts buy up and resell for profit.


            Fully 36% of spending on health care in China comes from patients, compared
            with 14% in the OECD , a club mostly of rich countries. The insurance
            system gives hospitals an incentive to treat out-of-province patients,
            since they must pay upfront. And China still has only two doctors per
            1,000 people, compared with 3.5 on average across the OECD . Most are
            poorly paid.


            Medical scandals further undermine confidence. A well-known case in 2018
            involved hundreds of thousands of children receiving faulty vaccines after
            the manufacturer fabricated inspection records. In February this year
            70 people were arrested for making fake covid-19 vaccines.


            Tougher regulations to protect doctors from angry patients do not seem
            to be working. Since the new laws were introduced in Beijing more than
            180,000 prohibited items such as knives have been seized at hospital entrances.
            With covid-19 under control, people are going back to hospitals. This
            could cause violence to rise again. Until the government deals with underpaid
            doctors and overstretched hospitals, it is likely to continue.'

        text: 'C HINA’S LEADERS seem sure that innovation can co-exist with authoritarian
            rule. Their confidence looks more rational than it once did: Chinese firms
            dominate some high-tech fields. Still, they have to explain a counterpoint:

            always followed.

            Uli Sigg, a Swiss businessman and diplomat, first reached China in 1979,
            as reformers began to dismantle the Mao-era planned economy. Later, he
            spent decades building an unrivalled collection of contemporary Chinese
            art. He was sent to China by Schindler, a Swiss manufacturer of lifts,
            for whom he established the first Chinese joint-venture with a foreign
            firm. Rather than a capitalist revolution, he describes years of caution,
            as entrepreneurs worried that open doors would slam shut. He recalls campaigns
            against Western “spiritual pollution” that frightened colleagues into
            ditching suits and ties and reverting to workers’ jackets in blue cotton.
            But time and again, opening sparked innovation.


            An art-lover, Mr Sigg reached China during a brief moment of creative
            daring. Months earlier, avant-garde artists had staged an unauthorised
            show on the railings of the national gallery in Beijing, before police
            swooped. Soon afterwards their movement was pushed underground for much
            of the 1980s. Many were young, self-taught, and technically crude. Few
            ordinary Chinese saw their art. Yet those who did were visibly excited
            by its spirit. “Traditional art takes you to a sublime place and then
            you come back. Contemporary art changes you. It produces an openness;
            maybe it is stupid or aggressive. But that is the link to creativity,”
            explains Mr Sigg. Foreigners often assumed that artists were dissidents.
            In fact, after growing up amid the bossy propaganda of socialist realism—vast
            canvasses of dauntless workers, bumper harvests and benevolent leaders—many
            were tired of politics and content to share their work with a few elite
            insiders.


            In the 1990s Mr Sigg set out to record this ferment, putting his own tastes
            aside to acquire hundreds of artworks as a public institution might. At
            one point he sought to preserve propaganda images that younger artists
            despised, though their aesthetic influence was obvious. He found former
            masters of socialist realism in dingy provincial apartments, and bought
            once-feted paintings now rolled up under their creators’ beds. These forgotten
            propagandists offered another lesson: skills prized in a closed system
            are little help when times change. An oddly poignant item in the Sigg
            collection is a very late work of socialist realism: a painting of Mao’s
            successor, Hua Guofeng, visiting North Korea in 1978, as doves flutter
            over his head. In its garish way it represents a peak of technical accomplishment,
            which soon became pointless as Hua was ousted and state-sponsored kitsch
            gave way to photography. As Swiss ambassador to China from 1995 to 1998,
            Mr Sigg watched cultural bosses wrestle with the Western world’s excitement
            over Chinese avant-garde art, and with the same foreigners’ confounding
            lack of interest in state-approved paintings of flowers and birds. Later,
            some officials moved to harness the global renown of freethinking artists.
            Before Ai Weiwei became an exile excoriated by the Chinese state, he helped
            to design the Bird’s Nest stadium for the Beijing Olympics of 2008. In
            2010 museum bosses in Hong Kong approached Mr Sigg, after hearing that
            he hoped to donate his art to a public gallery in China. The government
            had a site to offer, a vast new harbourside museum in West Kowloon, known
            as M+. This enthusiasm for experimental art was not a sudden whim. Starting
            in 1998, Hong Kong’s leaders had publicly fretted that the city’s economic
            base, built around finance, logistics and an overheated property market,
            was dangerously narrow. Their solution came in three parts: strengthening
            Hong Kong as a financial centre, increasing ties to the mainland and promoting
            creativity. The first local leader after the end of British rule, Tung
            Chee-hwa, called for Hong Kong to become “the most cosmopolitan city in
            Asia”. He offered support for creative industries, buttressed by schools
            that would promote critical thinking via a new subject, liberal studies.


            Mr Sigg warned Hong Kong officials about sensitive images in his collection.
            These include pictures of pro-democracy protests in June 1989 and one
            of Mao inspecting a urinal, in a homage to Marcel Duchamp. They were undaunted,
            asking why he would consider offering such works to mainland cities with
            strict censorship, and stressing Hong Kong’s artistic freedoms. In 2012
            he donated 1,463 works, worth $160m, and sold the city 47 more.


            The hunt for degenerate art


            That was then. Now, liberal studies are blamed for inspiring Hong Kong’s
            young to join anti-government protests in 2019, and schools must offer
            lessons in loving China. On April 19th President Xi Jinping called for
            Chinese universities to produce students who are both curious and absolutely
            loyal to the Communist Party.


            As for Mr Sigg’s collection, it is under fire from Hong Kong politicians
            seeking to prove their own loyalty. They accuse some images, notably one
            of Ai Weiwei giving the Tiananmen gate in Beijing his middle finger, of
            “spreading hatred” against China, in breach of a National Security Law
            passed last year. Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, pledges to
            be on “full alert” as M+ staff distinguish between artistic freedoms and
            national-security threats.


            The opening date of M+ is unclear. Mr Sigg can only hope that no artists
            are banned, for without Ai Weiwei, a Chinese contemporary art museum “would
            have no academic credibility”, he says. Asked whether he regrets his gift
            to Hong Kong, Mr Sigg replies that he collected the artworks to save them
            for China’s people. He is sure they will all be shown one day, though
            he may not see it.


            Perhaps China’s rulers are confident because the innovation they prize
            is technological, not cultural. Propaganda full of “positive energy” is
            creative enough for their needs. Hong Kong had its own artistic ambitions.
            But pleasing the party is the priority.'

        text: 'I N MARCH ELON MUSK , the world’s third-richest man, spoke to a conference
            in Beijing by video link. The cars that Tesla sells in China do not, Mr
            Musk insisted, share data with American security services. He was responding
            to the news that the Chinese armed forces had banned Teslas from their
            facilities over such concerns. A month later the firm took to Chinese
            social media to assure customers that the numerous cameras in their vehicles
            were “not activated outside North America”, and so could not be used to
            snoop.

            Concerns about security define the trade of technology between America
            and China. Most attention is focused on the extent to which Chinese giants
            such as TikTok and Huawei might be infiltrating America for nefarious
            purposes. But China has had concerns of its own. After the contours of
            American surveillance were laid bare in 2013 by Edward Snowden, a National
            Security Agency ( NSA ) contractor and whistleblower, the Chinese government
            began a campaign to replace all Western technology in government offices,
            lest it be used to spy. The brouhaha over Tesla’s cars shows how much
            security concerns have grown in the decade since Mr Snowden’s revelations.
            As connectivity becomes part of more consumer products, paranoia about
            their other uses rises.


            China’s suspicion contains an irony, however. Removing Western devices
            from Chinese networks will not keep China secure from its adversaries,
            because the Chinese government itself insists upon weakening the security
            of those networks and devices for its own purposes. Though America tends
            to hyperventilate about Chinese intrusion, it is China whose digital security
            is more precarious.


            This is because of the Chinese government’s insistence on being able to
            monitor and control the information that flows through the country’s digital
            networks. For instance, all messages sent on WeChat, China’s most widely
            used messaging application, must pass through central servers as plain
            text, unencrypted, so that the company can filter and censor them according
            to the government’s requirements. This makes those servers a ripe target
            for any foreign agents who want to spy on Chinese citizens, who between
            them have more than a billion WeChat accounts.


            Tencent, the app’s corporate owner, must build elaborate digital-security
            systems to allow it to keep inspecting its users’ messages while simultaneously
            denying that ability to attackers. That is a difficult task. “If I were
            a Western intelligence agency, those servers would be incredibly valuable,”
            says Matthew Green, a cryptography expert at Johns Hopkins University.


            Weak security is the rule, not the exception, in digital services for
            the Chinese public. Email and social media must all facilitate state access,
            as must industrial networks used to run factories and offices, even if
            the extent to which the government uses that access varies. In August
            it banned the most up-to-date version of a protocol used to encrypt web
            traffic, known as TLS , from the Chinese internet, because it makes online
            surveillance harder.


            The government has different security standards for itself, but these
            are secret. Speculation about the devices and systems that senior party
            members use to communicate is common. In 2013 Peng Liyuan, the wife of
            President Xi Jinping, was photographed using an iPhone, one of the few
            devices available in China which does offer a measure of security through
            its iMessage program. It was news around the world. Within a year Ms Peng
            was seen using a Chinese device.


            Internet users in China have long objected to the low standards of data
            protection. Online crime and leaked databases are rife. Last year someone
            stole the account details for all 538m users of Sina Weibo, a microblog,
            and posted them on the dark web for sale. The government has responded
            by promoting programs for companies to improve customer-data protection,
            even as it simultaneously enforces weakness in the security of all systems.
            But as long as the government demands access to data on Chinese people,
            those data can never be robustly protected.


            Though the American government does not publicise its cyber-operations,
            leaks demonstrate their extent. The documents provided to journalists
            by Mr Snowden show that the NSA found its way inside Huawei’s networks
            starting in 2007, looking for evidence they were being used as a back
            door by the Chinese government (if it found any, it was never made public).
            There is little question that spy agencies in America and other countries
            use China’s weak security to their advantage.


            China’s jeopardy increases as the value of data which flow through poorly
            secured networks goes up, both in economic and national-security terms.
            The Chinese government’s plan for economic growth ensures that this is
            what will happen. It plans to expand its digital economy, automating factories
            and creating smart-transport infrastructure. As with WeChat, if the government
            wishes to monitor these systems, it will build them to be less secure
            than they could be and so vulnerable to foreign interference in a way
            that equivalent networks in the West do not have to be.


            “The Chinese government knows the trade-off,” says Matt Perault, a technology-policy
            scholar at Duke University in North Carolina. “They are willing to bear
            it, which suggests that they are willing to tolerate a significant amount
            of foreign surveillance on their citizens.”


            The government’s calculation is unlikely to change. Its focus on surveillance
            and censorship of its own people is growing. But the tension between security
            against enemies within and those without will intensify. Cyber-attacks
            using weaknesses that the government itself has demanded might prove embarrassing.
            If the stand-off with Taiwan were to escalate, China’s weak security would
            be a serious disadvantage. And the more entrenched its reliance on surveillance
            and censorship becomes, the harder it will be to remove the weakness on
            which that control is built, should the day ever come when it no longer
            believes the trade-off worthwhile. '

        title: China presses Hong Kongers to accept a Chinese vaccine
        text: 'S INCE THE middle of March all Hong Kong residents over the age of
            30 have been entitled to book a vaccination. They even have the luxury
            of a choice: between the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine created in Germany or
            one produced by Sinovac, a Chinese firm. Yet despite plentiful supply
            only about 8% of the population have chosen to get a shot. One reason
            is rock-bottom trust in the government, the product of two years of political
            turmoil. It is only one way that the dismantling of Hong Kong’s freedoms
            has made controlling the virus more fraught.

            The take-up of vaccinations in Hong Kong lags far behind that in comparable
            places such as Singapore, where about 20% of people have been vaccinated.
            A survey carried out in January, before the vaccination drive began, found
            that only 37% of Hong Kongers wanted a jab. Since then local media have
            kept count of people who die in the days and weeks after a vaccination,
            despite copious evidence that vaccination makes death less likely, not
            more so. Infection rates are fairly low, so people who worry about side
            effects feel they can afford to put off their shot. On April 15th the
            government said it was about to start allowing people aged 16-29 to get
            one.


            The vaccine roll-out has become highly politicised. The big role given
            to Sinovac’s vaccine is controversial (people waiting to receive it are
            pictured). Sinovac has not published data from “phase-three” clinical
            trials in peer-reviewed journals, an important international standard.
            It appears to be less effective than the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines,
            which cut the risk of catching covid-19 by more than 90%. Trials of Sinovac’s
            jab find efficacy rates that range from 83% to a little over 50%, the
            threshold above which the World Health Organisation deems a vaccine suitable
            for general use. Speaking at a conference on April 10th, Gao Fu, a Chinese
            health official, appeared to accept that the efficacy of China’s vaccines
            was not very high and that it might be wise to combine them with a dose
            of a different product (he later said his remarks had been misinterpreted).


            Hong Kong’s vaccine-approval committee was not asked to consider the Chinese
            jab’s efficacy in comparison to Pfizer-BioNTech’s (which is distributed
            in Hong Kong by Fosun Pharma, a Chinese company) or to any other vaccine
            that had been peer-reviewed, says Keiji Fukuda, one of the members of
            the committee. “The politicians have all got Sinovac and the medical experts
            have all got BioNTech: what does that tell you?” says a medical scientist
            in Hong Kong. China has made decisions about vaccinations trickier by
            saying it will expedite visa applications for people who prove they have
            received a Chinese-made inoculation; as a result some people with family
            or business in the mainland feel compelled to accept it. “About one-third
            who took Sinovac were coerced, another third did it for some sort of personal
            gain or to curry favour with someone and the final third just wanted to
            get vaccinated,” says another public-health specialist. Tense politics
            has complicated Hong Kong’s response ever since the virus was first detected.
            In January 2020 Carrie Lam, the territory’s leader, argued against closing
            the border with the mainland, saying that doing so would be “discriminatory”.
            In response, 9,000 medical workers in a pro-democracy labour union went
            on strike. More than 60% of people surveyed by the Hong Kong Public Opinion
            Research Institute supported them. In September the government offered
            free covid-19 tests to the entire population. That policy borrowed from
            mandatory citywide testing campaigns that had taken place in some parts
            of mainland China. Yet fewer than 1.8m Hong Kong residents accepted the
            screening, out of 7.5m. Refusing the test was a way of expressing dissatisfaction
            with the government. And some suspicious residents fretted that their
            DNA might end up in mainland China. Worries about surveillance have also
            made people wary of mobile-phone apps, which they are supposed to use
            for contact-tracing purposes by recording their details when they check
            into venues such as restaurants. The perception that Hong Kong’s health
            officials are taking instruction from counterparts on the mainland continues
            to rankle. In December some travelled to Shenzhen to discuss ideas for
            detecting and containing the virus with authorities there. Since then,
            officials have taken to conducting what they have called “ambush-style
            lockdowns”, in which apartment blocks are cordoned off at short notice
            and everyone inside is tested.


            A report published in February by researchers at three universities in
            Hong Kong argues that informal networks formed during pro-democracy protests
            in 2019 may have helped the city weather the first part of the pandemic.
            Pro-democracy groups organised bulk purchases of surgical masks and disinfectant.
            Families, friends and neighbours reminded each other to wear masks and
            socially distance, drawing on lessons from 2003, when SARS , a disease
            caused by another coronavirus, killed almost 300 people in the city.


            Yet a sweeping security law passed in June 2020 has wrecked civil society.
            Most prominent pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong are now in jail or
            in exile. Few other people in Hong Kong have enough credibility to make
            locals overcome wariness towards vaccination. Pro-Beijing politicians
            are not much trusted. Lots of the celebrities made famous by Hong Kong’s
            entertainment industries—conscious that mainland China is their largest
            market—voiced support for the Communist Party during the protests in 2019.
            That has discredited them for many.


            Most public-health experts have concerns about the way China’s jab has
            been promoted in Hong Kong but are scared to speak publicly about it,
            say three such individuals. They worry that discussing the efficacy of
            a Chinese vaccine will hurt their careers, or even be deemed a violation
            of the city’s new security law, which bans any act that seriously “undermines”
            the work of the local or central governments. When the Communist Party
            imposed that legislation last summer, Ms Lam said it aimed to help Hong
            Kong “get back to normal”. It is very far from that.

        title: China’s tomb raiders are growing more professional
        text: 'B Y DAY MR WEI sold pancakes in Shaanxi, a northern province. By night
            he led a gang of grave robbers who tunnelled under an ancient temple near
            his shop. It took 11 months for them to reach the treasures buried beneath,
            which included gold statues of the Buddha and the bones of illustrious
            monks. Mr Wei and his cronies went on to dig several more passages from
            restaurants that they opened in the vicinity of shrines and pagodas. Over
            five years the looting earned them 12m yuan ($1.8m). Last year Mr Wei
            was sentenced to 15 years in prison. It was the second time that tomb
            raiding had landed him behind bars.

            China is redoubling efforts to catch grave robbers. Last year authorities
            arrested 2,400 such thieves and retrieved over 31,000 lost or stolen items,
            almost three times the number reclaimed during the previous year. The
            government agency responsible for protecting relics says it is in the
            midst of a 12-month crackdown on tomb raiders that involves more investment
            in staff and equipment. Punishments are growing more severe. In 2017 a
            man convicted of leading a gang of 200 grave robbers was put to death.


            Looting antiquities remains an alluring business, nonetheless. Some 90%
            of all the major tombs of which the whereabouts is known have been plundered
            at one time or other, says Ni Fangliu, an independent scholar. Sites in
            Shaanxi province—home to the world-famous terracotta army, among other
            ancient stuff—have been a target for centuries. But thieves are fanning
            out to new areas, including Xinjiang in north-western China and Inner
            Mongolia, in the north-east (a looted tomb in Henan province is pictured).


            The robbers are increasingly professional and often well-connected. Some
            are backed by investors who cover travel expenses and stump up for tools.
            On one visit to north-eastern China, Mr Ni was approached by a thief trying
            to raise funds to buy an excavator. He turned out to be the brother of
            a senior policeman. Rummaging around for shiny stuff is not the only way
            they make grave robbery pay. Criminals have been known to snatch bodies
            or funeral urns, then ask living relatives to pay ransom.


            Taboos around disturbing old graves are fading, a little. These were once
            so strong that even archaeologists shied from opening tombs, and some
            still set off firecrackers before digs to repel ghosts. But in 2006 two
            popular fantasy novels, “Grave Robbers’ Chronicles” and “Ghost Blows Out
            the Light”, made it look fun. Grave robbers’ picaresque adventures soon
            became the subject of films and television shows. That makes some officials
            queasy. In 2016 a Communist Party mouthpiece urged people not to “glamorise
            the grave robber” because “digging up ancestral tombs has always been
            a wicked practice”.


            The craze has had the benefit of strengthening public interest in archaeology.
            In March the state broadcaster live-streamed a dig that has unearthed
            3,000-year-old relics from Sanxingdui, an ancient site in Sichuan province.
            Millions tuned in. Yang Ying, a 25-year-old history buff milling around
            the Sanxingdui museum, credits “Grave Robbers’ Chronicles” for nurturing
            her interest in relics. But “lock up the thieves,” she says. '

        title: Mao’s revolution becomes a lesson about conformity
        text: 'O N A COLD and rainy recent night, on a mountain soaked in the blood
            of early Communist Party martyrs, Chaguan went for a walk to look for
            ghosts. None could be found. Instead Jinggang Mountain, in the southern
            province of Jiangxi, revealed itself as an oddly kitsch tourist complex,
            being readied for nationwide celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary
            of the party’s founding, in July. Toiling in the dark, work crews were
            installing floral displays and streetlights topped with red plastic flames.

            Tens of thousands died on the mountain between 1927 and 1929, as Mao Zedong
            and pioneering Red Army units took refuge on its bamboo-clad slopes, hiding
            from the ruling Nationalist regime and prowling warlords. Some died in
            combat, others in political purges. Others were killed by cold and disease
            in a region so poor that locals ate wild vegetables and trapped squirrels
            for meat.


            Today Jinggang Mountain is preserved as a “cradle of the revolution”.
            The local mayor, Jiao Xuejun, calls it “a spiritual place” that “purifies
            minds and clarifies people’s beliefs”. For all that, visitors hear little
            about its complex history. Rather, generic slogans reflect the party’s
            modern-day claim to rule, based on decades of economic development. A
            typical display, formed from illuminated red characters hanging from trees,
            reads: “The People Have Faith, the Country Has Strength, the Nation Has
            Hope”.


            Tour groups, some in replica Red Army uniforms, throng a museum filled
            with revolutionary relics before heading to souvenir shops selling Mao
            statues. Nearby, a China Executive Leadership Academy, overseen by the
            party’s Central Committee, trains high-flying officials from around the
            country. The academy calls itself a furnace where cadres are fired with
            renewed fervour, via residential courses in party history, discipline
            and theory: above all, “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics
            for a New Era”. Mr Xi visited in 2016. His tribute to the “Jinggang Mountain
            Spirit” is inscribed on an academy wall.


            The mountain witnessed important ideological battles. Mao argued with
            party chiefs in far-off Shanghai about how to recruit peasants as revolutionary
            warriors, after urban uprisings failed. Some sharp rows concerned the
            merits of political terror, and whether to seize land from all landlords,
            or just the richest. Mao favoured a selective use of violence. He held
            public-execution rallies at which local gentry were disembowelled with
            spears, and hung a scaffold with couplets in his own calligraphy, reading:
            “Watch Us Kill the Bad Landlords Today. Aren’t You Afraid?” Mao eagerly
            recruited mountain bandits as troops and grumbled about the “petty-bourgeois
            consciousness” of villagers, who rarely volunteered to join the Red Army,
            wanting instead to farm in peace. When an enemy army drew near in January
            1929, Mao abandoned Jinggang Mountain, leaving only a token force to defend
            thousands of villagers, wounded troops and Red Army wives and children.
            Massacres followed. An official history published in 1987, during a period
            of relative candour about Mao’s mistakes, cites a party inspector’s judgment
            that the Red Army’s 15-month stay left Jinggang Mountain “totally bankrupt”.


            Such debates are now played down. Chaguan visited the mountain on a government
            tour, organised to introduce foreign and Chinese journalists to local
            leaders preparing to fete the party’s centenary, as well as to officials
            studying at the academy. Pressed to explain the Jinggang Mountain spirit,
            those students carefully refer to Mr Xi’s definition of it, which stresses
            persistence, seeking truth from facts, tackling difficulties and relying
            on the masses. Smoothly, academy students trace a common “Red culture”
            connecting early martyrs with material prosperity today. One student,
            a party chief at a university in central China, recounts how he ferried
            his son on a bicycle in the 1990s, whereas his soon-to-be-born grandchild
            will ride in a car. Definitions of happiness evolve, but “the people have
            always had dreams of a better life,” he beams. Another, a provincial vice-president
            of the All-China Women’s Federation, insists that for 100 years “the party’s
            goal hasn’t changed, it is wholeheartedly to serve the people.”


            The right sort of fervour


            Academy students take a field trip to a mountain pass, Huangyangjie, made
            famous after the Red Army held off a bigger enemy force there. Standing
            to attention in rows, the middle-aged officials recite in unison a Mao
            poem about this victory. A lecturer assures them—in contradiction of the
            historical record—that long-ago locals showed “complete loyalty to the
            party”, praising a villager whose eight children all joined the Red Army.
            “Relying on the masses is not a pretty slogan, it’s a reality forged in
            fire,” the lecturer says, drawing a link with the mobilisation of ordinary
            Chinese to fight covid-19. “The form of the war may change, but the path
            of relying on the masses is still the right one,” he concludes.


            Officials offer simple morality tales about the selflessness of party
            members, from the Red Army commander who carried grain up the mountain
            to feed his soldiers, to the students who left “great universities” in
            Beijing to fight in Jiangxi 90-odd years ago. When visitors learn how
            highly educated patriots in their 20s sacrificed their lives, they realise
            that they can overcome their own difficulties, enthuses Mr Jiao, the mayor.
            An academy boss compares revolutionary martyrs to modern-day party secretaries
            who volunteered to work in harsh, remote villages to alleviate rural poverty,
            some of whom perished on the job.


            The blandness of these approved stories is no accident. It is hard for
            today’s rulers, obsessed as they are with order and conformity, to celebrate
            a revolution, even one a century old. A revealing commentary in the People’s
            Daily this month called for party members to practice “self-revolution”
            and “self-purification” via strict discipline. In the Xi era, a revolutionary
            spirit is one that submits to party authority. History is a way to measure
            how far China has come. Ghosts from the real, messy past are not welcome.'

            Some travel a long way to reunite over the three-day holiday, which ended
            on April 5th. Among them this year were the Zhaos of Leyun, a village
            in the lush Daba mountains of Sichuan province in the south-west. For
            migrant parents like them, there are living relationships that cause quiet
            grief, too. When their daughter, Lin, was just one month old the couple
            left her with her grandmother to allow them to return to their factory
            jobs on the coast. That was six years ago. Since then, Lin has spent only
            about 30 days with her parents. To her, this holiday’s get-together was
            with virtual strangers.

            There are about 31m people in China like Lin—children who have been left
            behind in their home towns or villages, usually in the care of relatives,
            while both of their parents work elsewhere. The largest wave of internal
            migration in history—involving about 300m people who have moved to cities
            over the past four decades—has battered many other families, too. In 2015
            Unicef, the UN agency for children, estimated that more than one in three
            children in China, or close to 100m, had experienced the prolonged absence
            of at least one parent. In nine out of ten cases, the main reason was
            migration.


            Another important cause has been China’s rigid system of household registration,
            known as hukou. Someone without hukou in the city where he or she lives
            is frequently denied access to local government-funded services, such
            as health care and schooling. Migrants therefore often have little choice
            but to leave children behind in their registered place of residence. Across
            China, many lives are racked by the pain this causes. At first Lin pined
            for her parents, says the girl’s 57-year-old grandmother, a bean farmer.
            Then her pleas grew fainter, until one day they stopped. Now Lin refuses
            to speak to her parents when they ring home. She shrinks from their attempts
            to hug her during their rare, fleeting visits back to Leyun.


            In recent years concern has grown in China about the plight of such children.
            State media have reported on their sufferings, including the torment of
            those abandoned with no one to look after them (in 2010 there were at
            least 2m without carers). About six years ago huge public debate was triggered
            by two such stories. One involved four siblings in the south who killed
            themselves with pesticide. They had been left behind with no guardian.
            The second was about another two left-behind siblings in the same region.
            They were murdered by two relatives who had been raping one of the children,
            a disabled 15-year-old girl.


            In February 2016 the government responded to the outcry by publishing
            guidelines for the protection of left-behind children. These called for
            their numbers to be reduced “significantly” by 2020. They advised local
            authorities to monitor guardianship arrangements—it is illegal to let
            minors live alone. They also urged hospitals and schools to do a better
            job of reporting cases of suspected harm. In 2017 a new rule required
            village officials to register all left-behind children. Another, in May
            2020, made failure to report neglect or abuse a possible crime. According
            to official figures, in 2018 local governments paired 76,000 unsupervised
            children with guardians, and helped the return to school of 160,000 left-behind
            children who had dropped out. Since 2017 the central government has kept
            a database of left-behind and vulnerable children, based on the records
            supplied by villages.


            Officials have focused their attention on a subset of those affected.
            The guidelines in 2016 count as left-behind only those who are under 16
            and have two parents working elsewhere. That year the government said
            there were just 9m children who could be classified as left-behind according
            to this definition. By 2018 the tally had fallen to under 7m. But children
            who have been separated from only one parent are often harmed, too. And
            it can matter which parent has left them. A Chinese study published in
            2017 found that school drop-out rates were lower among rural children
            living with only a mother rather than only a father (rates were highest
            when both parents were away). In 2019 a paper in Frontiers in Psychology,
            a peer-reviewed journal, concluded that the presence of at least one parent
            at home, especially a mother, lessened the risk that a left-behind child
            would self-harm as a teen.


            Rural parents often believe their presence is most vital when a child
            starts school. So they are more inclined to work elsewhere before their
            children reach that age, says Lu Shuang of the University of Hong Kong.
            More than a quarter of children in China under the age of two are cared
            for by people who are not their mothers, reports Unicef. The Chinese study
            of 2017 found that, as a proportion of all left-behind children, the number
            of under-fives had grown from 30% in 2000 to 40% in 2015. Many are never
            breastfed, depriving them of lifelong health benefits. That was so for
            Lin. As they grow older, children face other traumas. Since 2015 surveys
            by On the Road to School, an NGO based in Beijing, have revealed consistently
            high levels of depression among left-behind children. In 2019 nine in
            ten of them said they had suffered from emotional abuse, and six in ten
            reported physical harm. Close to one in three had been sexually abused.
            Such abuse often goes undetected. “The separation from parents means that
            children do not have the impulse to open up to them,” says Wan Miaoyan,
            a lawyer in Chengdu who has worked on cases related to such crime. She
            recalls one in which relatives discovered what had happened only when
            they came across a letter that the victim had written to herself. In it
            she described being raped by a teacher. A child therapist says current
            systems of support rely on people from the same village who may themselves
            be abusers, rather than on professional outsiders. Those systems are thinly
            stretched. Provinces with high numbers of left-behind children—Sichuan,
            a populous one, tops the ranking—tend to be among the poorest, with scant
            resources to devote to the task of protecting the vulnerable. But local
            governments are making an effort. Keep the Children Company, an official
            scheme in Sichuan, has involved setting up “children’s homes” (a space
            in the village where they can play, read books and receive help with their
            homework), and appointing “mothers” to whom children can turn for emotional
            support. The central government has helped. Since 2010 it has trained
            people in 660,000 villages as “child-welfare directors”, that is, to perform
            social work. It has also allowed the use of poverty-alleviation funds
            for spending on children’s welfare.


            In 2015 Lin’s village of Leyun was among the first to introduce a Keep
            the Children Company project. Liu Chunhua, an energetic kindergarten teacher,
            was chosen to lead it. In Chengdu, the provincial capital, she learnt
            how to broach sex and mental health with the village’s 20 children. Her
            efforts have paid off. A shy teen in Leyun was bewildered when she got
            her first period. A friend, also puzzled, prodded her to speak to “Mama
            Liu”. The teacher explained to the girl what was happening to her body
            and taught her how to wear pads. Village elders often gossip unkindly
            about the parents of left-behind children. Ms Liu has put a stop to that.
            She knows the harm it can do. Villagers had once taunted her own left-behind
            daughter with the false notion that Ms Liu only came back to see her eldest
            son. Her daughter became so dejected that Ms Liu quit her factory job
            and moved back to the village.


            Heading home, but not to mum and dad


            But keeping tabs on children is getting harder. Most villages once had
            a school, where teachers could check that students were not hurt, sick
            or distressed. In the past two decades, however, over 360,000 underused
            village schools have been closed to save money. Leyun’s hangs on by a
            thread. A decade ago it had 70 pupils. Now it has only two, in the youngest
            year-groups. Other children go to a school in Pujia, a town an hour’s
            walk down the mountain. They usually return to the village at weekends.
            Lin attends a kindergarten there. Asked if she gets good marks, Lin says
            she is slapped on the hand fewer times than her classmates.


            One glimmer of hope is that growing numbers of migrants are able to find
            jobs closer to their native villages, as factories move inland. Some parents
            from Leyun are settling with their children in nearby towns. And the covid-19
            pandemic is a cause of unexpected joy for some: it has forced many migrant
            workers to return to their original homes. Half of Leyun’s youngsters
            are currently living with both of their parents. That is “unheard of”,
            says Ms Liu, the teacher.


            Many of these parents were also once left-behind children. But rural conditions
            have improved immensely since those days. Zhu Yidan, a 25-year-old volunteer
            teacher who grew up as a left-behind child in Sichuan, says that when
            she was growing up people had to walk cross-country to reach villages.
            Now there are paved roads and children have enough food, clothing and
            toys. Parents can video-chat with them daily and buy presents for them
            online.


            But a new problem is emerging. Increasing numbers of children are being
            left in urban areas by one or both parents who move away for work. There
            were about 28m such children in 2015, nearly three times as many as in
            2000. Those who follow their parents from village to city have better
            diets and mental health than those who remain in the countryside, studies
            show. But those who are subsequently left behind in cities suffer higher
            rates of violence than those who stay in villages. Ms Wan, the lawyer,
            says there is “a debt owed by this country to its left-behind children”.
            The account is far from settled. '

        title: China thinks it can avoid Middle Eastern traps that caught America
        text: 'C HINA’S LEADERS are trying to reinvent how great powers operate in
            the Middle East. They have busied themselves in recent years signing trade
            deals and co-operation agreements with regional powers that are, most
            of the time, rivals or foes of each other. China talks of its warm ties
            with Israel and Palestine, and has invited both to send envoys to Beijing
            for peace talks. In the Middle East, a region where trust is hard to find,
            China is hailed as a reliable supplier of covid-19 vaccines and surveillance
            technology to Arabs and non-Arabs alike. The world’s largest oil importer,
            China is an irreplaceable trade partner both for Iran, the would-be leader
            of the Shia world, and for Saudi Arabia, its Sunni nemesis. More than
            once, Chinese warships have conducted separate exercises with the Iranian
            and Saudi navies, a few weeks apart.

            Chinese leaders sound sure that their country’s distinctive approach to
            geopolitics—one that stresses interests over values, and assumes that
            most foreigners can be bought for a price—will help them avoid the quagmires
            into which other outsiders in the Middle East have so often stumbled,
            from America to the colonial powers of old Europe. China’s foreign minister,
            Wang Yi, while visiting six Middle Eastern countries in late March, deplored
            “the bad consequences inflicted on the region by external interference”.
            In Iran Mr Wang signed a 25-year co-operation agreement. Its details remain
            murky, but the deal is thought to involve the exchange of cheap Iranian
            oil for help building telecommunications networks, hospitals, underground
            railways and, it is rumoured, ports on some of the world’s most strategic
            waterways.


            Chinese leaders make a virtue of their commercial focus. Addressing the
            Arab League in 2016, President Xi Jinping said that China sought no spheres
            of influence or geopolitical proxies in the region. Instead, he described
            a vision of progress built around economic growth, declaring that: “Turmoil
            in the Middle East stems from the lack of development.” Even the hardest
            problems, such as Iran’s loathing for America and Israel, are presented
            as puzzles that prosperity may solve. Notably, China insists that its
            promised investments in Iran will help rather than hinder efforts to prod
            the Iranian regime back into compliance with the nuclear accord (known
            as the JCPOA ) that was brokered by the Obama administration and other
            powers in 2015. It was abandoned three years later by America’s then-president,
            Donald Trump, who scorned the Obama-era approach of rewarding Iran for
            suspending nuclear-weapons research, and put his faith in harsh economic
            sanctions.


            Yin Gang is a veteran scholar of the Middle East at the Chinese Academy
            of Social Sciences, a government think-tank. He sets out why the administration
            of President Joe Biden should believe that China opposes Iran’s nuclear
            ambitions, even as it seeks to expand Sino-Iranian trade. China has selfish
            reasons for fearing an Iranian bomb, starting with the dangers of a regional
            arms race, says Mr Yin, a candid sort. “If there’s a Persian bomb, there
            must be an Arab bomb and a Turkish bomb,” he says. Though that may not
            directly threaten China, “If a nuclear war breaks out in the region, how
            would China do business with it?”


            China’s belief is that even the harshest economic sanctions do not stop
            countries from developing nuclear warheads, Mr Yin declares over tea in
            Beijing. He cites North Korea as a prime example. China’s logic is that
            Iran will have more reasons to behave if America lifts sanctions and allows
            Chinese, European and other companies to resume legal trade with Iranian
            partners. That is why China calls on America to do so, and on Iran to
            resume compliance with the JCPOA ’s nuclear curbs. The unblushing self-interest
            behind those Chinese arguments is actually reason to think them sincere.
            And the Biden administration appears inclined to heed them, for now. After
            a high-level meeting in March in Alaska between American and Chinese diplomatic
            chiefs, Iran’s nuclear programme appeared on a shortlist of areas for
            potential co-operation. Asked about Chinese plans to expand trade with
            Iran, a State Department spokesman called opposition to Iranian nukes
            one of a few “narrow areas of tactical alignment” between his country
            and China.


            Foreign diplomats in Beijing note that China does, in fact, pursue political
            goals in the Middle East, such as by pressing Iran and Arab nations to
            endorse repression of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, a region of western
            China. Mr Yin offers a cynical riposte. Uyghurs are a Turkic people, and
            Arabs and Iranians distrust Turks, he says, so “Xinjiang is not a political
            issue for them.” Still, he admits, many Chinese scholars worry about the
            balancing act that their country is trying to pull off. The Middle East
            is a place of opportunity but also “a trap, a swamp”, he says.


            Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!


            Some Chinese experts talk of America leaving a vacuum in the Middle East.
            Danny Russel, America’s assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
            Pacific Affairs in 2013-17, agrees that China senses a demand for a Chinese
            presence in the Middle East, amid talk of American unreliability. Chinese
            companies have been told to go out and sell advanced technologies that
            will carry their country’s values and technical standards around the world,
            notably via the Belt and Road Initiative. But ambitious deals come with
            political risks. “The larger your footprint, the more valuable your investments,
            the more vulnerable you are,” suggests Mr Russel, who is now at the Asia
            Society Policy Institute, a research outfit.


            Even as America pulls back from the Middle East, its presence hovers over
            Chinese calculations there. China’s most lucrative trade partners are
            Gulf Arab countries that cannot simply ignore America, their traditional
            security provider. America may yet ask old allies to take sides, for instance
            if China wants to build ports in the Middle East with dual commercial
            and military uses, or co-operate there over sensitive technologies. Amoral
            commercialism has helped China avoid many pitfalls in the region. Even
            so, its ambitions may yet run into the sands. '

        title: Vast satellite constellations are alarming astronomers
        text: 'O N MAY 24TH 2019 a Falcon 9 rocket built by SpaceX launched 60 communication
            satellites into a low orbit around the Earth. That evening they appeared
            as a string of sunlit dots moving across the sky, many of them as bright
            as the brightest stars, a source of passing wonder and mystery to casual
            observers—and a portent of doom to astronomers.

            “There were all these panic messages,” remembers Olivier Hainaut of the
            European Southern Observatory ( ESO ): “‘Oh my God, it''s the end, it''s
            the end of astronomy as we know it!’” Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer
            at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, says he was “gobsmacked”
            by how bright the satellites were. “I did some quick mental arithmetic
            and realised that thousands of satellites that bright would be a substantial
            fraction of the visible things in the sky…I felt an increasingly large
            pit in my stomach.”


            The panicked messages and the abdominal unease stemmed from the knowledge
            that those 60 lights were just the beginning. Up until that point communication
            satellites dealing with large amounts of data had been, for the most part,
            few and distant, sitting high and invisible over the equator. The largest
            “constellation” in low Earth orbit was that of Iridium, a satellite phone
            company, which had around 70 of the things. With 60 satellites SpaceX
            had almost equalled that with one launch. And there were a lot more launches
            to come.


            As originally proposed, the company’s plan for a system that could provide
            fast internet access to almost all parts of the globe called for 12,000
            satellites. In subsequent plans a second phase has been added which brings
            the total to 40,000 satellites arranged in orbital “shells” at altitudes
            from 335km to 614km.


            The company’s reusable rockets have allowed it to act on those plans at
            unprecedented speed. The first shell, consisting of 1,584 satellites,
            was completed in just two years; its services have beta testers over much
            of the world. SpaceX plans to put up more than a thousand a year from
            now on, and to pick up the pace when it replaces its Falcons with its
            next-generation Starships.


            The satellites seen on that first evening were, astronomers now know,
            anomalously bright. And the company has gone some way to making its more
            recently launched satellites less visible. But Starlink is not the only
            mega-constellation around town. According to filings made with the International
            Telecommunication Union ( ITU ), which regulates the use of different
            radio-frequency bands, and with national regulatory bodies, 100,000 non-SpaceX
            communication satellites could be launched into low orbits by 2030.


            OneWeb, a firm the British government recently took over, has launched
            more than 200 already and has filed a request to America’s Federal Communications
            Commission ( FCC ) for a total of almost 6,400. The FCC has also approved
            3,000 satellites as part of Amazon’s Project Kuiper. China, which has
            added “satellite internet” to its list of needed infrastructures, has
            filed with the ITU for 13,000 satellites at altitudes from 500km to 1,145km.
            The largest ITU filing was made in early November by Greg Wyler, founder
            and former executive chairman of OneWeb. In partnership with the Rwanda
            Space Agency he has applied to send up a constellation of 327,000 communication
            satellites.


            The reason that providing high-bandwidth services from space requires
            satellites in such large numbers is basically geometrical. Moving large
            amounts of data quickly is much easier if the receiver and transmitter
            are quite close. But satellites close to the surface move across the sky
            very quickly. So to be sure there are always a few in the sky over every
            user means you have to have a very large number of them.


            Big constellations offering broadband-internet services were first proposed
            in the 1990s. But there was neither the technological base to mass-produce
            satellites of sufficient sophistication nor the launch capacity to spread
            them across the sky in sufficient profusion. Now there is. And the smartphone
            revolution which is partly responsible for producing the robust and highly
            capable electronics such satellites need has also increased the world’s
            appetite for their services. According to the UN Development Programme
            only one in five people in developing countries is online. Morgan Stanley,
            a bank which predicts that the global space economy, worth $350bn in 2016,
            will be worth $1trn by 2040, thinks that 50-70% of that growth will be
            in satellite-internet services.


            That does not mean all the schemes can make a profit, or even get off
            the ground. But even if only some go ahead, the boom in the satellite
            population could transform the appearance of the evening and morning sky.
            How visible they would be to the naked eye and thus the general population
            is hard to say. If all the operators follow SpaceX’s example, maybe not
            too much; if not, the hours after sunset and before dawn could see dozens
            of faint lights racing through the sky.


            But in either case they will transform the practice of amateur and professional
            astronomy. A study by the ESO shows that at Paranal, a site in Chile which
            is home to the organisation’s magnificent, if prosaically named, Very
            Large Telescope ( VLT ) there might typically be over 500 satellites visible
            in the sky at the beginning of the night (see chart 1). In long astronomical
            exposures, as pictured above, the paths of such satellites streak the
            sky like the bars of a jail cell.


            The flash that split the night


            “It’s very much a paradigm shift,” says Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical
            Society, a British institution. “[The] large-scale utilisation of low
            Earth orbit is very different from anything we’ve had in the previous
            six decades in the space age.” That new paradigm raises the urgency of
            a range of problems: concerns about collisions and debris, the removal
            of defunct satellites, the effects of that much launch activity on the
            stratosphere, the allocation of radio frequencies, the need for arms control
            and so on. As Dr McDowell puts it, “Every time humanity moves into a new
            domain—the oceans or the air or space—we go, ‘Wow, this is enormous and
            really empty, we can throw as much garbage here as we want, and it’ll
            never fill up, right?’ Then pretty soon we go, ‘Oops, that wasn’t quite
            true.’ And we’re reaching that point in space.”


            Because the worries concerned are not entirely novel, for most of the
            issues raised by the satellite boom there is at least some sort of pre-existing
            setting for negotiation or arbitration, and some sense of who is responsible
            to whom. The Outer Space Treaty requires countries to take responsibility
            for objects launched from their territory while they are in orbit. Satellite
            radio emissions are regulated by the ITU . The Vienna convention is where
            you go to talk about any possibility of damage to the stratosphere. There
            are evolving procedures for avoiding collisions, and norms for how to
            dispose of satellites after their lives are over. But there is no forum
            for discussing what satellites look like from the surface. It is an externality
            which has never previously been a worry.


            This may seem a small thing. Astronomy is not a matter of life or death.
            But governments and philanthropists spend billions of dollars on it, thereby
            satisfying some of the world’s welcome appetite for wonder. Amateurs in
            their unknown tens or hundreds of thousands derive great joy from it.
            Astronomers may not have an inalienable right to an unobstructed sky.
            But a meeting on the subject, Dark and Quiet Skies, which was organised
            by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) and the UN last month,
            made clear their dismay at companies being able to take it away from them
            without so much as a by-your-leave.


            Conflict between star-gazing and communications is not entirely new. Radio
            astronomers have had to deal with interference from broadcasters for decades.
            But radio waves beamed from an antenna, whether on Earth or in orbit,
            can be regulated. Radio telescopes often sit in “radio-quiet zones” where
            the use of mobile phones and other devices is either limited or banned
            to ensure that incoming celestial signals are not drowned out; the ITU
            sets aside some wavelengths specifically for astronomical use.


            This does not mean that radio astronomers do not moan, nor that they do
            not have cause to. Emissions can often leak out of the intended frequency
            range. Scientists working on radio astronomy’s next big thing, the Square
            Kilometre Array, are very worried about the new constellations. The SKA
            is a €1.8bn ($2bn) project of 14 countries which will combine thousands
            of antennae of various types spread across South Africa and Australia
            into a single vast instrument.


            A study released by SKA scientists in 2020 showed that a constellation
            of 6,400 satellites using frequencies between 10.7 gigahertz and 12.7
            G Hz—the frequencies Starlink is licensed to use—would reduce that instrument’s
            sensitivity in a neighbouring frequency band allocated to radio astronomy
            by 70%. By the time the number of satellites reached 100,000, that band
            would be unusable. That would make some distinctive signals the array
            will look for impossible to spot. The scientists want to get the satellites’
            beams directed away from their antennae.


            Radio astronomers have to worry about the satellites all day and all night.
            Their optical peers focus their concerns on the twilight, or rather the
            twilights: night-sky professionals recognise a civil twilight, a darker
            nautical twilight, and a more velvet still astronomical twilight. At these
            times satellites remain illuminated by a sun which, from the observatory’s
            point of view, is already well below the horizon. The higher the satellite,
            the longer it remains illuminated, which makes OneWeb and the Chinese
            plans, both of which use orbits above 1,000km, more worrying than Starlink
            (see chart 2). Dr Hainaut reckons that the VLT could lose about 2% of
            its overall data to satellite streaks during the evening and morning:
            galling, but not incapacitating. But a revolutionary instrument elsewhere
            in the Andes will fare considerably worse. America’s Vera C. Rubin Observatory
            is designed not just to survey the whole of the sky in more detail than
            ever before, but to do so on a weekly basis, thereby capturing telltale
            changes and one-off events. Looking at lots of sky with a sensitive eye
            maximises the problems posed by satellites. “All of the features that
            make Rubin Observatory amazing for discovering unknown things are the
            exact same features that make it highly vulnerable to lots of bright satellite
            constellations,” says Meredith Rawls, an astronomer at the University
            of Washington who works at the observatory. Dr Hainaut reckons up to half
            of the Rubin Observatory’s images at twilight and dawn could feature streaks.
            Software should be able to remove them without losing more than 30% of
            the data, and possibly as little as 10%. But the streaks themselves are
            not the only problem. The chips in the camera’s light sensitive focal
            array—the largest in the world—can get overloaded if too much light hits
            them, creating electronic overtones and echoes that spoil the whole frame,
            not just the bit with the streak in it. For a programme devoted to looking
            for brief glimpses of rare events, that is a serious problem. Dialogues
            between astronomers and SpaceX engineers have mitigated the worst of the
            problems by tweaking the satellites’ design. In operation each of the
            Starlinks looks like a cross between a windsurfer and a junk. They consist
            of a three-metre-long rectangular board, known as the bus, on the bottom
            side of which are the antennae used to pick up and transmit signals, and
            a nine-metre rectangular solar panel that stands above the bus like a
            sail.


            Words like silent raindrops


            The reason the first Starlinks looked so bright was that when deployed
            from their Falcon 9 at an altitude of about 300km—they climb to their
            final orbits under their own steam—their solar panels spread out horizontally,
            thus maximising the reflecting surface as seen from Earth. Now the satellites
            keep their solar panels out of sight as much as they can. To minimise
            reflections from the bottom of the bus once the satellites are in their
            final orbit SpaceX engineers came up with the idea of a visor mounted
            to one side that casts a shadow over most of the Earth-facing side. This
            makes them considerably less visible.


            Dr McDowell welcomes these workarounds, but notes that they are not perfect,
            and that other operators may not be as amenable. The possibility of bright
            satellites in truly sky-spoiling numbers persists, he says, “even if none
            of the currently proposed constellations are going to do it. We have to
            plan for it and we have to regulate against it.”


            Regulation, though, will take time. The IAU plans to make recommendations—possibly
            stipulating that the brightness of space objects in future should be dimmer
            than magnitude 7 (ie, invisible to the naked eye)—to the UN ’s Committee
            on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. That body may, one day, turn the package
            into a recommendation for a vote to better protect astronomy at the UN
            ’s General Assembly. Such a vote might then lead to a new protocol under
            the Outer Space Treaty. But even if that all happens, it will not do so
            any time soon—not least because other issues raised by the mega constellations,
            such as risks from debris, will doubtless seem more pressing.


            For professional astronomers an alternative solution to the problem might
            be to get over it not metaphorically, but physically: make ever more of
            their observations from space. This is not a perfect defence. If the telescope
            is in a low-ish orbit itself, satellites can still get in the way. A team
            led by Mark McCaughrean of the European Space Agency has found that in
            the 2010s the number of 11-minute exposures on the Hubble Space Telescope’s
            widest-field camera scarred by a satellite streak was 3.6%. In the first
            half of 2021 it was 6.6%. “It''s gone up 80% in the space of a year,”
            says Dr McCaughrean. “And that''s just at the beginning.” And because
            the Hubble is closer to the satellites in question, the streaks are out
            of focus; some show up as bands of light which fill up half the image.


            Higher orbits are available. The James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ),
            due to launch next month, will sit 1.5m kilometres from Earth free of
            all such concerns. Radio astronomers have long fantasised about setting
            up shop on the far side of the Moon, the only place in the solar system
            which none of Earth’s radio chatter can reach. But these are terrifically
            pricey projects. The JWST cost around $10bn—putting it in the same ball
            park as the entire Starlink constellation.


            The same factors which allow commercial operators to launch many more
            and cheaper satellites could in time help science, too. But astronomy
            tends to depend on one-off flagship missions that simply do not respond
            to the same economies of scale. Changing its culture, and the expectations
            of its professional practitioners, would be a hard task.


            And no satellite can replace the delight of star-gazing from your own
            back garden, or a local hilltop, with just a telescope or a pair of binoculars
            and the whole universe to look at. The intrusion of space-age infrastructure
            will not worry all such observers all the time—to see a satellite can
            be a thrilling thing. But the more routine the sight gets, the less likely
            it will be to elicit a frisson of the technological sublime. Eventually,
            it will become just another of the mundane ways in which the world obscures
            its wonder. '
